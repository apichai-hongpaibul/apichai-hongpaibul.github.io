<p>&lt; The Association Head Is (1) .<br />
Sizzle! An egg landed lightly on a pan with oil.  </p>
<p>Sunny side up? Over easy?”[1.<br />
I would like sunny side up, please.<br />
I answered, slightly blankly.<br />
I hadn’t even dreamed that I would be able to see the sight of the Seseong Guild Leader making a fried egg for me to eat.<br />
If a fortune teller had predicted this scene for me before the regression, I would’ve gotten angry, telling them to at least keep a limit when saying charlatan-like nonsense.<br />
Then, the smell of bacon frying wafted to my nose.  </p>
<p>Would you like to drink coffee? Or fruit juice?Noah said, holding up and showing a basket with mangoes, bananas, and oranges.<br />
When I asked for juice, he peeled the fruit with skilled hands.<br />
The sound of a mixer working rang out noisily in the kitchen.<br />
For Noah, there was no need to say twice, and that person, Sung Hyunjae, also was excessively good looking and handsome, so it felt like I was seeing some 4D kitchen advertisement.<br />
If the two of them worked in a cafe or something, the business would probably go well even if it tasted super bad.<br />
com Unlike my expectations, this place wasn’t a hotel, but a vacation home.<br />
Apparently we had moved to a personal-use vacation home so that we wouldn’t stand out, since there was a commotion over the Kraken case.  </p>
<p>…What is it that you want?My gaze helplessly kept on going toward the burn exposed between the collar of his shirt.<br />
I asked Sung Hyunjae, as I used a fork to poke and burst the yolk that was less cooked, like I asked for.<br />
Reply that you protected Yerim because you had some other goal.  </p>
<p>You’re saying something saddening.<br />
It is not good for my mental health to just decide that you simply helped out for my sake, while even resolving to take injuries.<br />
I have to be bothered by it and it feels dirty, so I think I will be restless in my sleep for about a week.<br />
I won’t say that I’m a virtuous person.<br />
…I was almost about to throw up[2.<br />
Noah, who was sitting next o me, also had a sour expression.<br />
Sung Hyunjae continued speaking with a hint of laughter.  </p>
<p>But I’m a type that’s generous toward a possession that has enough worth.<br />
And it’s embarrassing not being able to properly protect your things.<br />
I am not Sung Hyunjae-ssi’s.<br />
In the first place, wasn’t it a just a joke.<br />
I was always sincere.<br />
Please do not say something scary.<br />
If it is sincere, I will run away.<br />
I’ll wait about a day for you to hide.<br />
I have no intention of playing hide-and-seek with you.<br />
It definitely should have been a joking conversation, but because he said he was sincere or whatever, I needlessly felt concerned.  </p>
<p>Anyways, thank you for protecting Yerim, and I will also pay the price for the injury.<br />
Let’s say I didn’t hear the last part.<br />
You’re welcome.<br />
It was something that was right for me to do, for Han Yoojin-gun.<br />
So what do you want.<br />
It’d be good if you stay fine until I get bored.<br />
I’m talking about mentally.<br />
com for a better experience.<br />
And my body does not matter.<br />
If the bulk decreases then it’ll get easier to carry around.<br />
For a moment, I wondered what he was saying, and then I frowned.<br />
It was an F-Rank body, so I acknowledged that it wasn’t particularly useful, but still, that was too much.  </p>
<p>Your words are harsh.<br />
Noah became furious instead of me.<br />
But Sung Hyunjae didn’t even glance at him.<br />
That person was solely ignoring Noah.  </p>
<p>If someone is speaking, you should at least look at them.<br />
Is there any need with the owner here?…What bullshit was this now.<br />
I tried complaining that Noah-ssi wasn’t a kiseungsu and didn’t have an owner and was a perfectly independent person, but it didn’t get through at all.<br />
It was to the point that I felt wronged over the fact that I was agitated for a moment about him taking care of Yerim while getting injured.<br />
As expected, his personality was bad.<br />
com for the best novel reading experience.<br />
Noah-ssi, will you please give us a moment?I said to Noah, after finishing the simple breakfast.  </p>
<p>Yes, I will be in the backyard.<br />
Noah left, and I brought up the matters from last night.  </p>
<p>Did you take care of the things to take care of.<br />
Thanks to you.<br />
A few high rank Hunters tried to run away, but there wasn’t anybody who slipped away.<br />
Since the hotel was completely flooded, not being able to find the corpses wouldn’t be seen as weird either.<br />
Sung Hyunjae said, satisfied.<br />
Most of the people who had been at the hotel had fallen into his hands.<br />
Whether they were alive or dead.<br />
Seeing how he was taking everything including the corpses, it seemed like there was a Hunter who had a skill similar to Yerim’s White Corpse at Seseong.  </p>
<p>Please do not forget to share any usable information.<br />
Didn’t you not only say you have no interest overseas, but even insist that I not even think of dragging you in? Though if you changed your mind, it’s welcome.<br />
Of course I am not even going to glance at it, but you can pass it onto Haeyeon.<br />
I was tired with just the matters within the country, so why overseas? I was just going to scoop out the stamina potion from Japan and Hunters from China, and then end my interest there.  </p>
<p>And please gather the items that were worn and send them over.<br />
It was hard to take items that were inside inventories.<br />
On top of that, if you died, the items all disappeared along with your inventory.<br />
That was why I purposely made them hand over items during the auction.<br />
It was too much of a waste to leave them to disappear.  </p>
<p>You’re also frugal.<br />
It really is praiseworthy.<br />
You should take the possessiveness out of your gaze.<br />
If you’re going to insist that I’m your item, why don’t you trade with skills? He was completely trying to take advantage[3.<br />
Ack! It’s Han Yoohyun! Ahhh!There was the sound of Yerim’s voice screaming like she had touched a cockroach.<br />
At one point, she had said he was a good looking and capable oppa, but it had changed a lot, huh.  </p>
<p>Ahjussi! When did you wake up?Yerim rushed out of the bedroom, letting out loud stomping footsteps.  </p>
<p>If you’re at the level of not realizing at all when an F-Rank moves next to you, then that’s a problem.<br />
It was because I was so tired.<br />
Is there bread.<br />
Here.<br />
I’m saying that getting exhausted to that extent itself is a problem.<br />
Since it means there was a burden on your body.<br />
If that piles up, even if you’re S-Rank, you’ll get sick.<br />
In a situation where your life is at risk, there’s no helping it, but don’t go overboard if you can help it.<br />
You too, Yoohyun.<br />
I said, looking at my brother, who was coming into the kitchen with a face that still at a little bit of sleepiness left.  </p>
<p>Don’t do something like crawling into an S-Rank dungeon with just one person.<br />
Yeah.<br />
But you’re the most severe in going overboard, hyung.<br />
That’s true.<br />
And you faint at the drop of a hat.<br />
On top of that, you are stat F.<br />
At the drop of a hat, she said.<br />
It didn’t seem like it had happened that much.<br />
Wasn’t it about three times? It wasn’t a lot.  </p>
<p>Am I, who is cooped up at home, and you guys, who go around dungeons, the same.<br />
How many dungeons do you think you’ve gone around in lately, hyung? If you really just stayed at home, I wouldn’t even worry.<br />
Um, it was just somehow.<br />
I had also had absolutely no intention of frequenting dungeons this diligently.<br />
Things didn’t always go the way you planned in life.  </p>
<p>Eggs for me too! Over easy!Yerim shouted toward Yoohyun, who was taking out eggs.<br />
Even while frowning, displeased, another egg was held in Yoohyun’s hand.  </p>
<p>I’ll do it for you.<br />
Sit.<br />
It’s okay.<br />
Irin appeared on top of Yoohyun’s shoulders as he held a pan.<br />
I tried waving hi to it, but there was no particular reaction.<br />
Was it not that it just couldn’t speak? Maybe intellectual abilities were also restricted, because it acted like a normal lizard.  </p>
<p>Seseong Guild Leader, thank you for the coat.<br />
Still, please do not forget about what you agreed to take care of.<br />
Of course.<br />
…Take care of? Of what?At my question, Yerim replied like it was nothing as she ripped the bread.  </p>
<p>I helped a little in moving the corpses and people yesterday.<br />
The part time job pay for that.<br />
What? Why would you get a kid to do something like that?.<br />
It was simply a transport part time job.<br />
What do you mean simply-!Tuk, the blade portion of a kitchen knife was grabbed in Sung Hyunjae’s hand.<br />
Yoohyun placed the plate of fried eggs on the table.<br />
Both of them were sunny side up.  </p>
<p>I said I wanted over easy.<br />
Our house only deals in sunny side up.<br />
At the cold words telling her not to eat if she didn’t like it, Yerim grumbled as she put the fried egg into her mouth.<br />
Still, I felt like they had gotten a little closer than before.<br />
Was it really that kids became closer as they fought? Sung Hyunjae lightly tossed the kitchen knife that had flown toward himself back to Yoohyun.<br />
A fork hit the kitchen knife and the knife that spun in the air struck down on the table.<br />
It was a marble table, but that went in near halfway.  </p>
<p>Someone who is an adult should not play around at the dining table.<br />
Though the young master started it first.<br />
Yoohyun, I get that it’s irritating, but you can’t throw knives in the kitchen.<br />
Yeah, sorry.<br />
And then he hesitated for a moment, before looking at me with eyes like a scolded puppy.  </p>
<p>…I was in the wrong yesterday.<br />
You kept your promise, but I acted however I wanted, so I’m really sorry.<br />
My brother was good-hearted, as expected.<br />
See how he apologized right away.  </p>
<p>It’s okay.<br />
Well, it’s fine if people didn’t get hurt.<br />
Sung Hyunjae quietly raised his hand.<br />
So what.<br />
Still, when the burn mark entered my eyes, I was a liiittle sorry and my conscience was pricked, so I spoke again.  </p>
<p>There wasn’t anybody who died, so it’s okay.<br />
So what if someone get a little hurt.<br />
There’s potions and healers.<br />
Wow, what is that.<br />
There really is no doubt that ahjussi will just say it’s okay even if the world collapsed because of Han Yoohyun, as long as he apologizes.<br />
I mean, even if it’s me, to that extent…… If the world collapsed, then it would be uncomfortable for Yoohyun to live too, so I should block it before that.<br />
And it’s also because of the elemental.<br />
Fire elementals are normally a bit like that.<br />
Like, when you use the power, your self control gets weaker and you get aggressive.<br />
You’re not used to it yet, so it’s even more like so.<br />
Umm, and.<br />
Did I have to say it? Irin stared straight at me as if urging me on.<br />
Or it could just be looking at me.  </p>
<p>Well, even if you make a bit of trouble.<br />
Even so, I love you, Yoohyun.<br />
So don’t pay too much mind………Rin, hyung is struggling.<br />
I’m doomed if I get embarrassed.<br />
Calm down.<br />
Let’s act calmly, like it’s nothing much.<br />
Thankfully Yoohyun didn’t say anything else and grinned.  </p>
<p>Ahjussi, what about me.<br />
Of course I love you too, Yerim.<br />
Though number 1 is my brother.<br />
Ah, that’s of course.<br />
If you said he wasn’t, then it would be more surprising.<br />
Was it to the point of being a matter of course? Just then, Sung Hyunjae looked at a message on his cell phone and stood up from his seat.  </p>
<p>They’ve arrived.<br />
com Then he went out toward the front door.<br />
When I followed, wondering what it was, the door opened, and Kang Soyoung and, -Kkiaaang!.<br />
Peace?Peace jumped into my arms.<br />
-Kkiooong.  </p>
<p>There, there.<br />
How did you come all the way here.<br />
I brought him over.<br />
Kang Soyoung said with a tired face.  </p>
<p>Peace… because Han Yoojin-nim was not there, he was little… cranky.<br />
Still, he might have understood that we were going to you, so he did cooperate, but…… I could not bring Blue as well.<br />
Thank you.<br />
You have worked hard.<br />
She smiled weakly and said it was okay.<br />
When I got back, I should quickly raise Comet for her first.<br />
I was sorry.  </p>
<p>You said Noah-ssi is here as well, right? Can I come in for a moment.<br />
Ah, yes.<br />
He went toward the backyard a while ago.<br />
Thank you!Kang Soyoung, who had regained her energy in one breath, ran toward the backyard.<br />
I faintly heard Noah’s surprised shout.<br />
Please calm down, Soyoung-ssi.<br />
In my arms, Peace was wagging his tail without a break, happy to see me.  </p>
<p>I was planning on going back quickly, but it took a long time.<br />
Sorry, Peace.<br />
-Kkeuang, kkyang! Soothing Peace, I turned to look at Sung Hyunjae.<br />
Um, thank you for your consideration.<br />
Even though it felt dirty that the kindness was excessive, I was truthfully thankful that he brought Peace over.  </p>
<p>Now the star rating should be about three.<br />
I will put it as that.<br />
I hope that your seawater allergy also disappears.<br />
As you know, this neighborhood is an island.<br />
Adding on, the tour this time is definitely no-option and no-tip.<br />
Is the accompaniment of three kids and a pet also possible.<br />
Of course.<br />
If the terms were that good, then I couldn’t refuse.<br />
It would be sad to just go back after coming here with the kids anyways.<br />
I worried that we might stand out too much, but since there was an excessively amazing tour guide, clearly he would know to take care of it on his own.  </p>
<p>com for the best novel reading experience When I went inside and said we should go sightseeing in Hong Kong, Yerim jumped around excitedly.<br />
Yoohyun seemed like he was pleased, too.<br />
I woke up the still sleeping Chirpie, and joined with Noah and even Kang Soyoung, and we went outside.<br />
It was too little with one day, so we had a fun time until the next day, too.<br />
There were slight incidents here and there in the middle, but a big problem didn’t occur.<br />
It wasn’t like there were only one or two kids, so having no incidents was impossible.<br />
And then we got on the plane back home.<br />
The news that I was rescued due to the Haeyeon Guild Leader was revealed to Korea, and the airport was filled with people.<br />
More than I had expected.<br />
‘It’s something I brought onto myself but……’ Still, the interest was too much.<br />
It felt like my face was becoming hot on its own.<br />
I shouldn’t go outside with my face uncovered for about a month – it was embarrassing.<br />
[1 he actually asks lit.<br />
‘half cooked? fully cooked?’ bc that’s how you phrase it in krn but I wanted to used egg terms.<br />
and yeah I kno ‘over easy’ is still technically half cooked, but not a lot of ppl use ‘over medium’ or ‘over hard’ anyways so it’s not as readily understandable.<br />
[2 it’s more like ‘have an upset stomachindigestion’ but I think this tl is more understandable in eng.<br />
Ppl do say things like ‘feel like I’m going to throw up’ in krn, too, though.<br />
[3 lit.  </p>

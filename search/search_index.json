The snow that dyed the world in white melted and disappeared and flowers started to blossom along with the sunlight. The Plum Flower that bloomed in Mount Hua right now was called the early plum. It was because it was the flower that bloomed the earliest. A year had passed by and Ju Seo Cheon had recently turned ten years old. A few months also passed since he started doing the enhancement gymnastics\u2026 No, the enhancement mountain climbing. Im proud of you. Yu Jong Mok smiled with a teary face. It must have been really hard these past few months but you finally did it. Climbing the mountain ends today. Yu Jong Mok patted Ju Seo Cheons shoulders a few times and then turned his back like he couldnt endure it. He couldnt endure how content he was with his disciple that managed to finish his teachings to the end and wiped his tears with his sleeves. I dont like cliffs, I dont like cliffs\u2026I dont like cliffs\u2026 Please stop. Stop telling me to cheer up. I dont like it, this cliff\u2026Stop\u2026 Ju Seo Cheon mumbled with cloudy eyes. His eyes were dead as a frozen pollack. The enhancement gymnastics then continued for a few months! No, the hellish training that was disguised with the name of enhancement gymnastics! Compared to that, the Nakan hell was really nothing. The Nakan Hell pushed you to the limits right before you passed out but at least it didnt threaten your life. It only ended at being a little bit painful. But in the case of the mountain climbing, relaxing for even a moment meant that it threatened your life. It wasnt one or twice that he almost fell down because he felt drowsy & had misstepped. But the worst of all was that he wasnt allowed to cry or groan no matter how hard it was. For example, he wasnt allowed to tell his master to save him or that he couldnt do it anymore. Its fine, you can do it! Yu Jong Moks voice was heard saying that. The problem was that his voice was filled with cheering and enthusiasm, so the pebbles and gravels fell down at the shock. Just thinking about that gave him the chills. It wasnt once or twice that he almost died because of that so he gave up on asking his master to save him or complain. The times he wanted to give up? There were hundreds, no, thousands of times. But when he finally managed to climb up the cliff Yu Jong Mok came running like lightning and said with a sorry voice. Im really sorry to be like this but its unavoidable as it is for you. You should rather resent me. The only person he could call as his family in all his life. When the person that loved his disciple until the end apologized several times with a face full of guilt, Ju Seo Cheon wasnt able to say out loud that he wanted to give up. \u2018A master that rather beats me up with a stick would be better\u2026 If that was the case, he would have really gotten angry and rebuked but well, he couldnt do so because it hurt his heart. In the end, he couldnt deny climbing up the cliff and followed as he was told to and he finally finished it all. It was less difficult the more he did it but he had merely gotten accustomed to it, it wasnt that the danger had disappeared. When he took a wrong step or when the rock bed collapsed, he felt his life flash before his eyes. But the effects of the training were as clear as the danger that followed. Ju Seo Cheons body had grown to the point one couldnt recognize it in these past few months. When he wanted to take a rest after returning from the training center, he got dragged by his master and went out to climb the cliff. In the beginning, he took all day to climb it to the top. At first, he rested a few times in the middle of climbing. It was because it was that hard. But he soon regretted that decision after some time passed. He realized that it became more dangerous the darker it became and after that, he didnt rest no matter how hard it was. He only rested the essential amount and focused on climbing up the cliff before the sunset. After finishing climbing up the cliff, he dragged down his exhausted body and loosened up his muscles. He then filled up his dantian by circulating energy and fell asleep. He was able to see great effects thanks to this systematic training method. His health and strength increased due to continuous cliff climbing. But, it had a massive burden on his body, especially his muscles. However, the wounds in his muscles were recovered by circulating his internal energy through his entire body. Ju Seo Cheons body got comparatively better and grew noticeably stronger due to the training that repeated every day. Thanks to that Ju Seo Cheon looked like a fourteen-year-old when he was only ten. Ju Seo Cheon was worried that he may not grow taller because of the excessive growth but fortunately, he was able to grow taller. Part of it was because of the internal energy of the Water Spirit Fruit but it was also thanks to the vitality and regenerative power he obtained through the Plum Blossom Art. The second day. The emotion he felt after opening his eyes when morning came was a relief. Laughter came out on its own as he didnt have to think of climbing disgustingly dangerous cliffs anymore. If someone had asked him why he had stopped, he would have slapped that person. Ju Seo Cheon executed the Plum Blossom Fist Techniques in the training center as usual. Um? The instructor, Cheol Ung, looked at Ju Seo Cheon. \u2018He is growing well because he is at his growth phase. Did he grow once again? It was too much that a ten-year-old looked like a fourteen-year-old kid but it wasnt that there were no precedents of it. Compared to the outside, Hua Sect had balanced and regular meals and the disciples used most of the time using their bodies so it would be weirder if they didnt grow up. \u2018Ju Seo Cheon huh? The speed at which he advances in the Plum Blossom Fist Techniques is fast and if he possesses a modicum of talent he will grow to be quite fine. Cheol Ung thought like that and smiled in a satisfied manner. Whew, what do I do after returning? Ju Seo Cheon returned to his residence. In addition, he had already completed the Plum Blossom Fist Techniques. It was because it wasnt particularly difficult and also because he had the memories of his past. It was quite awkward that he was at his residence at the time he had to be climbing the cliff. But it was a nice feeling of awkwardness. Yu Jong Mok entered through the door after the time it took for a kettle of tea to brew up passed. Master. You seem to be in a good mood. Yu Jong Mok smiled softly. \u2018Yes. Im really glad that Im not going to the cliff. Those words almost came out from his mouth. If it was Yu Jong Mok, he felt like he may get depressed saying \u2018you dont like being with your master\u2026? Your body aches because you arent moving, right? No\u2026yes, a little bit. He wanted to lie down and not move. It was the truth. Haha, I knew you would say that. Come, get out. Ju Seo Cheon followed Yu Jong Mok outside. The two people entered a personal drill hall that was near their residence. It wasnt that big but it was a place for the two of them. Yu Jong Mok pointed at a wooden sword he prepared beforehand. Take this, use it. Starting today I will teach you swordsmanship. \u2018Ahh, is it already time for that. Mount Hua was renowned for its blade since time immemorial. The real martial arts of the Mount Hua Sect began when one wielded the blade. The importance of these words were transmitted to others. The disciples that just entered Hua Sect and the ones that taught these disciples also thought like this. Before one wielded the sword, all their training they did was merely physical training for their body. Ju Seo Cheon jumped in excitement when he heard that they would teach him swordsmanship. Now. I will show you a demonstration of the swordsmanship you will be learning. This is the Plum Blossom Sword. Yu Jong Mok executed the basic swordsmanship of Hua Sect, the Plum Blossom Sword. He spread it out slowly so that it could be engraved in the eyes of his disciple. \u2018Mm. Ju Seo Cheon sat on the floor of the training hall and observed. \u2018I already know all of that. He had been one of the Five Elders in his past life and in his later years. Ju Seo Cheon was a level above Yu Jong Mok when it came to swordsmanship. The Plum Blossom Sword was easy enough for him to recreate that there was no need to practice it. He just had to get his body familiar with it just like the Plum Blossom Fist Techniques. No, it wouldnt take as much time as the Fist Techniques The base and structure of the two techniques were almost the same, so he would be able to execute it easily if he learned the secrets behind them. They didnt learn the Plum Blossom Fist Techniques first for nothing. But he couldnt say \u2018master. Im sure I know more about the Plum Blossom Sword than you. In the end, he had to pretend to be as interested as possible on the outside. \u2018Mm, was he a peak level expert\u2026? What came after the third rate, second rate, and first-rate was the peak. You could only be called an expert after climbing to that boundary. \u2018In my memories, master passed away right before becoming a peak level expert\u2026 It wasnt that good to bring up the memories of his past. It was especially so if it was related to his master whom he considered his father. Yu Jong Mok, the one that passed away in bed after suffering. He didnt even want to imagine that. Whatever the case, Yu Jong Mok was an exceptional peak expert even among other peak experts. The pinnacle was right before his eyes but he couldnt reach it. \u2018\u2026. Huh? A thought flashed his eyes while following a plum flower with his eyes. \u2018What master is lacking is not internal energy but insight. If I am able to teach him that\u2026? Martial artists, and especially beings that were facing a wall were thirsty to get some advice. It was the same for unskilled people but experts contained the words of people that were a few levels above them. It was because they would be able to obtain a clue to overcome that wall from the ones that had already passed that wall and achieved the peak. Those things didnt happen frequently and there were people looking for experts to obtain this insight. \u2018Right, this is it! He came to himself. \u2018If hes lacking insight and isnt able to cross to the next boundary I just have to help him do so. He had to be glad that Yu Jong Mok was at the peak boundary. If he had been at the Transcendent boundary and was facing the wall to become an Unrestrained Realm Expert, not even Ju Seo Cheon would be able to help him. It was because of the height of the wall but also because the insight each Transcendent had on climbing to that boundary was as different as heaven and earth. \u2018Theres no need to teach him anything. I have to confirm what he is curious about and I just have to give him a hint\u2026 In addition, simply giving the answer in martial arts held no meaning at all. He wouldnt be able to understand it even if he gave him the answer so if something went wrong the wall would only get thicker. \u2018Good, lets do it. It seemed like the role of master and disciple had changed but he didnt care about those trivial things. He, who had lost everything and was thrown to the world as an orphan. The person that saved that kind of person was his master. For Ju Seo Cheon, his master was like the sky and the world itself. He was someone that couldnt even be compared to the leaders of Murim or even the emperor. The respect and grace he felt after returning in time were the same, and he was able to say confidently that he could become an evil spirit for his master. \u2018Master is not someone who will remain at that boundary. \u2026 Donate $ on Kofi and mention \u2018Volcanic Age for keep our release speed!

In this past month, Ju Seo Cheon received the teachings of the Plum Blossom Sword Art from Yu Jong Mok and pondered about how he should transmit his insight to his master while swinging his sword. He was able to think of other things freely because he perfectly understood the basics already. But Ju Seo Cheon was overlooking one thing because he was too deep in his thoughts. It was that Yu Jong Mok was observing him. \u2018How can this be! Yu Jong Mok saw how Ju Seo Cheon swung the sword and couldnt hide his shock. \u2018Something seemed strange this past year but I didnt know he would be this much! The Plum Blossom Sword Art is easy because its only the basics. If one has already completed the Plum Blossom Fist Techniques, then the difficulty would drop considerably. But even so, it was impossible to execute the Plum Blossom Sword Art that freely and calmly after only a week passed. Even if Yu Jong Mok explained the theory behind it, it was weird to be able to achieve that level. If that is the case, there is only one conclusion that can be made. \u2018My disciple was a genius! Ju Seo Cheon wasnt a genius at all. It wasnt that he had outstanding reflexes or a great innate physique and his blood vessels and constitution werent good either. Yu Jong Mok knew that better than anyone else as Ju Seo Cheons master. But talent wasnt limited to physical abilities or mental capacities. It could also be a talent towards the sword. Yu Jong Mok thought that Ju Seo Cheon fell in that category. No, precisely speaking it was more correct that it was a misunderstanding. Ju Seo Cheon was only repeating the footsteps he had achieved in the past. It was also because the Plum Blossom Sword Art was merely the basics. Thats why Yu Jong Mok could only ascertain that Ju Seo Cheons talent towards the sword was geniuslike as he didnt know the situation. If Ju Seo Cheon hadnt gone through the hellish training called the enhancement gymnastics, he wouldnt have been able to do as much. He hid his skills to the utmost degree as to not get suspected while thinking of the advice he should give to his master. But he ended up executing everything in the Plum Blossom Sword Art unconsciously because his physique got so good thanks to the hellish training. \u2018If hes at this level, he would be able to enter the Lotus Pavillion\u2026 The Lotus Pavillion. It was one of the internal structures of Mount Hua Sect and at the same time, an institution that only selected disciples could be affiliated to. In other words, it was a scaled-down version. It was a place for disciples that showed outstanding talent to get separate training before they became adults. Special beings like Jang Moon In and the disciples of the Five Elders entered the Lotus Pavillion and received training. It was because those disciples were able to take a step ahead of others because they had special masters. In addition, a ninth of the Plum Blossom Examiners were graduates of the Lotus Pavilion. Unfortunately, Yu Jong Mok wasnt able to enter the Lotus Pavilion because of his weak constitution. Whatever the case, with Ju Seo Cheons skills he would easily be able to enter the Lotus Pavilion and receive a higher level of training. If he was lucky he could receive a miraculous medicine and could also receive exclusive teaching from the instructors. If he could only prove his strength and talent, he would be able to receive the best treatment. It may seem unfair but these things were common in small sects if they werent a big sect like Mount Hua. A few days later. Ju Seo Cheon made a request to Yu Jong Mok. Master, pardon my rudeness but will you be able to show me a sword art besides the Plum Blossom Sword Art? A sword art besides the Plum Blossom Sword Art? Yes. Ju Seo Cheon nodded. Yu Jong Mok fell in his thoughts at the request of his disciple. The disciple that had started learning the Plum Blossom Sword Art for only a week. No, the disciple that had only grabbed the sword for one week. Even if he had talent, teaching him a higher-ranked sword technique when he didnt even complete the Plum Blossom Sword Art was utter madness. That was what Yu Jong Mok was worried about. Ju Seo Cheon noticed and spoke quickly. But of course, Im not asking you to teach me. Its just that I have never seen another sword technique besides the one of Mount Hua. I want to see the proper sword technique of our sect as one of its disciples. Um, fine. I understand. If it wasnt teaching and just showing, it would pose no particular problem. If one approached the training center they were able to see early inner disciples practicing sword techniques besides the Plum Blossom Sword Arts. If only observing was already a problem, he would have already stopped him early on from getting close to the training center. Before Yu Jong Mok took a stance, he sensed the gaze of his disciple filled with expectations and fell in thought. \u2018Lets see\u2026 There were five sword techniques appearing in his head. They were the Universe Sword Art, Withered Flower Sword Art, Plum Blossom Brilliant Sword Art, Five Elements Plum Blossom Sword Art, and the Fourteen Stances of the Plum Blossom Sword Art. The Universe Sword and the Withered Flower Sword were sword techniques that were a level above basic sword techniques. Most of the inner disciples learn up to this point and descend. The Plum Blossom Brilliant Sword was one of the few delightful Pleasant Swords in Mount Hua and the Five Elements Plum Blossom Sword was a sword technique that contained the five elements, just like its name implied. The two of them were at the boundary of being a top-ranked technique and only recognized inner disciples could learn it. At the same time, it was also a limit for the inner disciples. Excluding these two, top-ranked martial arts couldnt be learned if you werent disciples of the head temple. Lastly, the Fourteen Stances of the Plum Blossom Sword was a reduced size edition of the Twenty Stances of the Plum Blossom Sword. It was at the peak of the top-ranked martial arts and the difficulty it had was that high. Even Yu Jong Mok wasnt able to complete it. I am now going to show you the Fourteen Stances of the Plum Blossom Sword. Yu Jong Mok made a decision at the end of his thoughts. He hadnt been able to complete it yet but if he was going to show something to his disciple, he wanted to show the best he could. I want to ask you something before showing it to you. Do you know about the Fourteen Stances of the Plum Blossom Sword? Yes, master. The Fourteen Stances of the Plum Blossom Sword is a sword technique of Mount Hua that is composed of the first stance Plum Blossom Alongside The Road up to the fourteenth stance called the Faded Plum Blossom. The Twenty Stances of the Plum Blossom Sword was composed of twenty stances, just like its name implied. If you are able to execute up to the Thousand Miles Plum Blossom Essence, your sword will start to emanate the scent of the plum flower. In the past, he had laughed at it saying how good it was to smell the scent of the plum flower but that was a really foolish thought. Releasing the scent of the plum flower while executing a sword stance meant that it could influence the laws of nature itself. It was a boundary all swordsmen could only dream of. Disciples of Mount Hua Sect didnt hold the Plum Blossom Sword Examiner as their idols for nothing. Right, you know it well. I will add a bit more of explanation in case you make a misunderstanding. Even though the stances of the Fourteen Stances of the Plum Blossom Sword and the Twenty Stances of the Plum Blossom Sword may look similar, they are a bit different. If they were the same, wouldnt the Fourteen Stances of the Plum Blossom Sword just be called the Twenty Stances of the Plum Blossom Sword? You are talking about the reduced version of it, the lower compatibility with it. Ju Seo Cheon knew everything already but he still responded to Yu Jong Moks long explanation. The Fourteen Stances of the Plum Blossom Sword was a scaled-down version of the Twenty Stances of the Plum Blossom Sword. Its difficulty decreased as fourteen stances were organized into one sword technique but its power also decreased that much. You know it well. Good. That much is enough. Yu Jong Mok smiled in satisfaction at his disciples answer. He then took a stance and executed the Fourteen Stances of the Plum Blossom Sword. Ju Seo Cheon saw his master execute the Plum Blossom Alongside The Road and felt a pain in his chest. \u2018Im seeing something I couldnt in my past life. In his past life, learning the Plum Blossom Sword Arts was already too much for him. Maybe it was because of that that Yu Jong Mok didnt show Ju Seo Cheon any top-ranked martial arts. It was because it would be an obstacle for him. Originally, he was planning to teach Ju Seo Cheon when he reached a certain level but unfortunately, he passed away before he could do so. The number of times Ju Seo Cheon could see his masters swordsmanship could be counted on one hand, even though they had the closest relationship as a master and disciple. \u2018Ah, this is not the time to be like this. Ju Seo Cheon scolded himself inwardly and focused on Yu Jong Mok. In their current state, Yu Jong Mok was much higher in terms of boundaries but Ju Seo Cheon was above as someone that had once become an Unrestrained Realm expert. In reality, Ju Seo Cheon was able to grasp Yu Jong Moks sword and martial arts after a short time passed. \u2018It seems perfect up to the ninth stance but hes starting to get stuck from the tenth stance, the Fading Plum in Full Bloom. Fortunately, it doesnt seem like hes lacking insight but training\u2026 Ju Seo Cheon had also experienced the Fourteen Stances of the Plum Blossom Sword in his past life. He was confident that he would be able to execute it more perfectly than Yu Jong Mok if he was given a little bit of time and internal energy. \u2018Huh? Ju Seo Cheons eyes started to shine. \u2026. Hap! Yu Jong Mok executed up to the fourteenth stance, the Faded Plum Blossom. He was sweating as if proving that he had spent quite a lot of stamina and internal energy. Now, those were all of the fourteen stances. But this bad master of yours is lacking in skills and wasnt able to perfectly execute them. Im sorry. He was Yu Jong Mok indeed. Normally, they would put on some airs to try to act cooler in front of their disciples. No, even if they werent in front of their disciples, most martial artists and the ones belonging to the Righteous Faction especially had a high pride. They would be embarrassed about their lacking abilities and would try to hide it but Yu Jong Mok revealed it like nothing and apologized saying that he couldnt show his martial arts properly. No, its okay master! Ju Seo Cheon clapped his hands with eyes filled with unlimited trust. It was an outstanding sword art that martial artists and even the leaders of Murim would gasp with exclamation! You brat, didnt you hear the words \u2018Too much water drowns the miller? Excessive compliments are heard as flatteries. Yu Jong Mok laughed. But it didnt seem like he was in a bad mood. I will take that into account master. That wasnt flattery at all. To Ju Seo Cheon, Yu Jong Mok was something akin to a God. Now, do you want to see another sword technique? Now that it turned like this, I will show you something else. Ju Seo Cheon cheered inwardly at those words. And differently to his feelings, he acted like a simple ten-year-old kid that had a strong curiosity. I want to see the Five Elements Plum Blossom Sword Art master. You are giving this master of yours the opportunity to restore my incompetence. I have already completed the Five Elements Plum Blossom Sword Art early on so I will show you all of it. Disciples of the head temple would learn a few top-ranked martial arts after they complete the Plum Blossom Sword Arts and one of them was the Five Elements Plum Blossom Sword Art. Master, this lacking disciple of yours is lacking knowledge so I couldnt see what passed in front of my eyes when you executed the Fourteen Stances of the Plum Blossom Sword. Pardon my rudeness but will you be able to do it slowly this time? Of course. Yu Jong Mok got really satisfied when his ten-year-old disciple showed great passion for studying martial arts. He had talent and his posture was also excellent. He was really proud as a master to have a disciple like this. Yu Jong Mok started to execute the first stance of the Five Elements Plum Blossom Sword Art slowly, just like Ju Seo Cheon requested. For reference, in martial arts, whether it be sword arts or fist arts, executing any of them slowly was much harder to do. Swinging a sword slowly needed a considerable amount of strength, stamina, and endurance. It was the same for concentration. That was because executing an art slowly meant that they were that much aware of it. Even if it was a martial art that they completed before, they would be needing a considerable amount of concentration if it wasnt at the level of the Plum Blossom Sword Arts. And Ju Seo Cheon was precisely aiming for that. This translation belongs to Centinni. You can donate on Ko-fi(from the main page) to keep our release speed and mention the novel you are supporting.

In this past month, Ju Seo Cheon received the teachings of the Plum Blossom Sword Art from Yu Jong Mok and pondered about how he should transmit his insight to his master while swinging his sword. He was able to think of other things freely because he perfectly understood the basics already. But Ju Seo Cheon was overlooking one thing because he was too deep in his thoughts. It was that Yu Jong Mok was observing him. \u2018How can this be! Yu Jong Mok saw how Ju Seo Cheon swung the sword and couldnt hide his shock. \u2018Something seemed strange this past year but I didnt know he would be this much! The Plum Blossom Sword Art is easy because its only the basics. If one has already completed the Plum Blossom Fist Techniques, then the difficulty would drop considerably. But even so, it was impossible to execute the Plum Blossom Sword Art that freely and calmly after only a week passed. Even if Yu Jong Mok explained the theory behind it, it was weird to be able to achieve that level. If that is the case, there is only one conclusion that can be made. \u2018My disciple was a genius! Ju Seo Cheon wasnt a genius at all. It wasnt that he had outstanding reflexes or a great innate physique and his blood vessels and constitution werent good either. Yu Jong Mok knew that better than anyone else as Ju Seo Cheons master. But talent wasnt limited to physical abilities or mental capacities. It could also be a talent towards the sword. Yu Jong Mok thought that Ju Seo Cheon fell in that category. No, precisely speaking it was more correct that it was a misunderstanding. Ju Seo Cheon was only repeating the footsteps he had achieved in the past. It was also because the Plum Blossom Sword Art was merely the basics. Thats why Yu Jong Mok could only ascertain that Ju Seo Cheons talent towards the sword was geniuslike as he didnt know the situation. If Ju Seo Cheon hadnt gone through the hellish training called the enhancement gymnastics, he wouldnt have been able to do as much. He hid his skills to the utmost degree as to not get suspected while thinking of the advice he should give to his master. But he ended up executing everything in the Plum Blossom Sword Art unconsciously because his physique got so good thanks to the hellish training. \u2018If hes at this level, he would be able to enter the Lotus Pavillion\u2026 The Lotus Pavillion. It was one of the internal structures of Mount Hua Sect and at the same time, an institution that only selected disciples could be affiliated to. In other words, it was a scaled-down version. It was a place for disciples that showed outstanding talent to get separate training before they became adults.

Yu Jong Moks appearance was contained in Ju Seo Cheons eyes. Yu Jong Mok was still slowly executing the Five Elements Plum Blossom Sword Art but he was quite different from when he was executing the Fourteen Stances of the Plum Blossom Sword. He was giving consideration to his disciple so that he was able to see comfortably. Thats why he chose to take bigger postures while facing the direction of Ju Seo Cheon so that he would be able to see more. It would have been hard enough to execute the movements slowly but he was also giving consideration to his disciple. But his consideration strangely stopped when the third stance of the Five Elements Plum Blossom Sword Art started. A posture that couldnt be grasped well came out. It wasnt because Yu Jong Mok got tired in the middle or it was troublesome. It was the opposite. He had forgotten the existence of his disciple and fell completely in the Five Elements Plum Blossom Sword Art. \u2018The future changes with my actions. I didnt know that I would be the master twice. Just now Ju Seo Cheon sensed something strange when Yu Jong Mok showed his martial arts. \u2018An unbalance in the five elements. The water attribute has increased exponentially due to having consumed the Water Spirit Fruit. He had stopped his vessel from leaking with the power of the Water Spirit Fruit. At first, he believed that that was everything but it seemed like that wasnt the case. It was faint but its remnants still remained. Ju Seo Cheon didnt know it until Yu Jong Mok showed him the Fourteen Stances of the Plum Blossom Sword. Yu Jong Mok manifested sword qi with all his strength and soon got able to feel frost energy and water energy from it. Thats why Ju Seo Cheon requested him to execute the Five Elements Plum Blossom Sword Art slowly. The Five Elements Plum Blossom Sword Art was a martial arts containing the five elements, just like its name implied. It was just perfect to fix the unbalance of the five elements. And having requested him to execute it slowly was to make him concentrate. He may be able to miss it because it was really minute. \u2018I didnt know that one miraculous medicine would make it like this\u2026 He fixed his weak constitution that he thought was a chronic disease and that became a clue to increase his boundary. While he was thinking, Yu Jong Mok executed the Five Elements Plum Blossom Sword Art until the last stance and then immediately begun circulating his internal energy. It was to absorb the insight he gained right now and increase his boundary. Ju Seo Cheon stopped his breathing and stood guard to not obstruct Yu Jong Mok. \u2018The unbalance of the five elements is merely the trigger. The remains of the Water Spirit Fruit, its not that there was a lot of water energy either. Even if it was an unbalance, that level wasnt serious at all. It only complimented the minute parts, the frost energy stabilized even more and increased to the size of a fingernail. Then what is Yu Jong Moks real insight? \u2018Rest. Yu Jong Mok was a diligent hard worker. But that level of hard work was a bit excessive. It was to the point that he was called a blockhead. It was the same even after he fell from being a candidate of the Plum Blossom Sword Examiner. He never stopped to rest his entire life and always continued to work hard. Some of his fellow disciples got sick of his diligence. This hard work was so excessive it was seen as an obsession. It didnt matter no matter what anyone told him. He had been diligent and worked hard his entire life and after entering Mount Hua Sect he had been tense all the time, never stopping to rest. You could already see that by looking at the enhancement gymnastics. Yu Jong Mok had just pushed himself too much. \u2018Ahh, theres a need to let it go at times. The five elements was a cycle, a natural flow. Yu Jong Mok thought, pondered and understood about the consequences that would bring when he fixed the unbalance of the five elements. He realized that sometimes he had to leave things flow naturally like water after comprehending the cycle. He would awaken and comprehend the wood energy, the five elements and the cycle. And he finally succeeded in overcoming that wall. A long time passed and Yu Jong Mok finally opened his eyes. The light in his eyes and the degree of his qi changed completely. Leisure that couldnt be seen before was now seen. But his soft and comfortable smile remained the same. Now that leisure was added on top of that, he now looked like a wise man. Its not me who is the one teaching but you. All of this is thanks to you. The first thing he said were words filled with a sweet voice. Ju Seo Cheon yelled with a thrilled voice. Congratulations master! Ju Seo Cheon got sincerely happy. Before returning in time he had only been luggage to his master. He was regretful as hell that he wasnt able to see him on his deathbed. Ju Seo Cheon didnt feel comfortable as he felt like he had only been a weight to his master\u2026 so he felt happy that at least he was able to fix an old problem like this. Ju Seo Cheon got thankful at his new life once again. Ho, so he reached Peak? Yu Jong Mok had reached the Peak. It didnt take a day for those news to spread. Those are really happy events! There were many experts around the nine factions such as Mount Hua. It wasnt called a great sect for nothing. Even if that was the case, they werent that numerous. Peak level experts were treated as a precious force even in great sects. And Yu Jong Mok became one of those pinnacle experts. It was enough to receive attention. The fellow disciples of Yu Jong Mok went to meet him and congratulated him. Ju Seo Cheon saw for the first time that there were so many visitors coming to their residence in all his life, including his current and previous ones. I believed that you would be able to do it someday. As expected of the Smiling Gentle Sword. Its not much but please take it. Yu Jong Moks influence wasnt that wide. The ones he could call as close were merely five. The number of people that visited him recently surpassed the hundred but most of them were people that wanted to form a connection with him. It was an obvious thing but in Mount Hua Sect there werent only people belonging to that sect. In case of the inner disciples of high status, they would have servants to carry their buyings and some escort knights. Besides them there were also clients, merchants and all kinds of other people around them. There were a considerable number of them having the objective of forming a connection with the disciples of the head temple. No, precisely speaking almost all of the visitors had that thought. This place was none other than the Mount Hua Sect, one of the nine factions. If they could establish a connection they would have gained one of the most reliable swords. In the case of normal sized sects, almost no one would be able to push them around them if they had a connection with a disciple of the Mount Hua Sect. Put that in a bad way, it meant that they could exercise the connection to the Mount Hua Sect as an authority. \u2018Ugh, master is so\u2026 Ju Seo Cheon let out a sigh inwardly. He had learned how to rest but his upright nature was still the same. \u2018He could just say that he is tired and no one would approach him anymore\u2026 Ju Seo Cheon was worried about him but Yu Jong Mok only smiled softly and faced the people. But the fortunate thing is that his master knew how to differentiate between an honest and dishonest man so he wasnt treated as a pushover or get into any sort of owing debt or favor He showed great proficiency at not accepting gifts or accepting them at a moderate line. At the peak of the Lotus Peak was the Shang Palace. It was a structure that existed since the beginning of Mount Hua Sect and it hadnt changed once throughout its long history. They had called the best architects to structure it and a considerable amount of effort, time and money was spent into maintaining it. That place was that important. The landscape you could see of Mount Hua from Shang Temple was such a grand and beautiful sight that everyone would drop their jaws looking at it. Its reputation was so amazing that elegant people would dream of it at least once. Besides the scenery, the palace itself was also really incredible. It was obvious as they had spent an astronomical amount of money by calling the best architects, even though that happened a long time ago. Its perfect structure was one thing and its outer appearance was also outstanding. They didnt have the same power as the emperor so they made it look poorer than the golden palace but it was still one of the best structures in the midlands. Yu Jong Mok, I knew he would be able to accomplish it. Inside the temple, an old man with a flashing white beard was sitting in front of the top seat, and laughed in a good mood. There were a hundred experts below this old man. Those people were called the Hundred Experts. Most of them were composed by pinnacle experts and there were also some Trasncendent Realm Experts among them. Did that mean that the peak of Murim was the Hundred Experts? No. There were beings that were above Transcendents and had surpassed the limits of humans and received awe and respect. They were the Heavenly Ten Seats. The Hundred Experts were always under the sky. There is always someone flying above the one that was running. There were ten absolute experts above the sky. And they were called the Heavenly Ten Seats. The old man that was sitting at the top seat was one of those people. The Sword Master and wise man Woo il Moon. The master of Mount Hua Sect! If it wasnt for his weak constitution he would have already become a Plum Blossom Sword Examiner. its really regretful. Middle aged men were sitting at the sides of Woo il Moon. They were the aides of the leader of Mount Hua, the Five Elders that had the most authority after the leader. Hm, I heard that his weak constitution got better after he reached the pinnacle rank\u2026 Oh. Woo il Moon showed interest. Yu Jong Mok was a peak expert but he wasnt considered as a proper force until now. It was because of his weak constitution. That wasnt a bad thing. He had a good personality, was so hard working he was called as a cold blooded person and had quite the talent. But he lacked endurance due to his weak constitution so he didnt receive proper tasks. Hm, how about examining him once again? In the position of Mount Hua Sect, leaving Yu Jong Mok aside was just like letting a talent rot. A wise decision. The future changed once again. After that, Yu Jong Mok was mentioned while a meeting was taking place in the Shang Temple. This meeting that was opened by the leader and the Five Elders was nominally and virtually the best meeting held in Mount Hua. The matter of what to do with a pinnacle expert was enough to enter in the meeting of the Shang Temple. And about fifteen days later. After consuming the Water Spirit Fruit, Yu Jong Mok didnt cough even once since fifteen days passed after the meeting in the Shang Temple ended. The chief executives came to the conclusion that Yu Jong Moks weak constitution was completely healed. They called him and gave him a new task. And that was making an appearance in Kang Ho. Oh, my god. Something really unprecedented had happened. After Ju Seo Cheon became Yu Jong Moks disciple, there has never been a time that he went out to Kang Ho besides friendly matters. He didnt know how surprised he got after hearing those news. Ugh. Honestly speaking, he felt uneasy. Yu Jong Moks future would be pitch black if he was to appear in Kang Ho. Even if we were talking about Ju Seo Cheon, the one that knew the future of dozens of years later, it didnt mean that he knew everything. the current situation was like that.

Yu Jong Moks appearance was contained in Ju Seo Cheons eyes. Yu Jong Mok was still slowly executing the Five Elements Plum Blossom Sword Art but he was quite different from when he was executing the Fourteen Stances of the Plum Blossom Sword. He was giving consideration to his disciple so that he was able to see comfortably. Thats why he chose to take bigger postures while facing the direction of Ju Seo Cheon so that he would be able to see more. It would have been hard enough to execute the movements slowly but he was also giving consideration to his disciple. But his consideration strangely stopped when the third stance of the Five Elements Plum Blossom Sword Art started. A posture that couldnt be grasped well came out. It wasnt because Yu Jong Mok got tired in the middle or it was troublesome. It was the opposite. He had forgotten the existence of his disciple and fell completely in the Five Elements Plum Blossom Sword Art. \u2018The future changes with my actions. I didnt know that I would be the master twice. Just now Ju Seo Cheon sensed something strange when Yu Jong Mok showed his martial arts. \u2018An unbalance in the five elements. The water attribute has increased exponentially due to having consumed the Water Spirit Fruit. He had stopped his vessel from leaking with the power of the Water Spirit Fruit. At first, he believed that that was everything but it seemed like that wasnt the case. It was faint but its remnants still remained. Ju Seo Cheon didnt know it until Yu Jong Mok showed him the Fourteen Stances of the Plum Blossom Sword. Yu Jong Mok manifested sword qi with all his strength and soon got able to feel frost energy and water energy from it. Thats why Ju Seo Cheon requested him to execute the Five Elements Plum Blossom Sword Art slowly. The Five Elements Plum Blossom Sword Art was a martial arts containing the five elements, just like its name implied. It was just perfect to fix the unbalance of the five elements. And having requested him to execute it slowly was to make him concentrate. He may be able to miss it because it was really minute. \u2018I didnt know that one miraculous medicine would make it like this\u2026 He fixed his weak constitution that he thought was a chronic disease and that became a clue to increase his boundary. While he was thinking, Yu Jong Mok executed the Five Elements Plum Blossom Sword Art until the last stance and then immediately begun circulating his internal energy. It was to absorb the insight he gained right now and increase his boundary. Ju Seo Cheon stopped his breathing and stood guard to not obstruct Yu Jong Mok. \u2018The unbalance of the five elements is merely the trigger. The remains of the Water Spirit Fruit, its not that there was a lot of water energy either. Even if it was an unbalance, that level wasnt serious at all. It only complimented the minute parts, the frost energy stabilized even more and increased to the size of a fingernail. Then what is Yu Jong Moks real insight? \u2018Rest. Yu Jong Mok was a diligent hard worker. But that level of hard work was a bit excessive. It was to the point that he was called a blockhead. It was the same even after he fell from being a candidate of the Plum Blossom Sword Examiner. He never stopped to rest his entire life and always continued to work hard. Some of his fellow disciples got sick of his diligence. This hard work was so excessive it was seen as an obsession. It didnt matter no matter what anyone told him. He had been diligent and worked hard his entire life and after entering Mount Hua Sect he had been tense all the time, never stopping to rest. You could already see that by looking at the enhancement gymnastics. Yu Jong Mok had just pushed himself too much. \u2018Ahh, theres a need to let it go at times. The five elements was a cycle, a natural flow. Yu Jong Mok thought, pondered and understood about the consequences that would bring when he fixed the unbalance of the five elements. He realized that sometimes he had to leave things flow naturally like water after comprehending the cycle. He would awaken and comprehend the wood energy, the five elements and the cycle. And he finally succeeded in overcoming that wall. A long time passed and Yu Jong Mok finally opened his eyes. The light in his eyes and the degree of his qi changed completely. Leisure that couldnt be seen before was now seen. But his soft and comfortable smile remained the same. Now that leisure was added on top of that, he now looked like a wise man. Its not me who is the one teaching but you. All of this is thanks to you. The first thing he said were words filled with a sweet voice. Ju Seo Cheon yelled with a thrilled voice. Congratulations master! Ju Seo Cheon got sincerely happy. Before returning in time he had only been luggage to his master. He was regretful as hell that he wasnt able to see him on his deathbed. Ju Seo Cheon didnt feel comfortable as he felt like he had only been a weight to his master\u2026 so he felt happy that at least he was able to fix an old problem like this. Ju Seo Cheon got thankful at his new life once again. Ho, so he reached Peak? Yu Jong Mok had reached the Peak. It didnt take a day for those news to spread. Those are really happy events! There were many experts around the nine factions such as Mount Hua. It wasnt called a great sect for nothing. Even if that was the case, they werent that numerous. Peak level experts were treated as a precious force even in great sects. And Yu Jong Mok became one of those pinnacle experts. It was enough to receive attention. The fellow disciples of Yu Jong Mok went to meet him and congratulated him. Ju Seo Cheon saw for the first time that there were so many visitors coming to their residence in all his life, including his current and previous ones. I believed that you would be able to do it someday. As expected of the Smiling Gentle Sword. Its not much but please take it. Yu Jong Moks influence wasnt that wide. The ones he could call as close were merely five. The number of people that visited him recently surpassed the hundred but most of them were people that wanted to form a connection with him. It was an obvious thing but in Mount Hua Sect there werent only people belonging to that sect. In case of the inner disciples of high status, they would have servants to carry their buyings and some escort knights. Besides them there were also clients, merchants and all kinds of other people around them. There were a considerable number of them having the objective of forming a connection with the disciples of the head temple. No, precisely speaking almost all of the visitors had that thought. This place was none other than the Mount Hua Sect, one of the nine factions. If they could establish a connection they would have gained one of the most reliable swords. In the case of normal sized sects, almost no one would be able to push them around them if they had a connection with a disciple of the Mount Hua Sect. Put that in a bad way, it meant that they could exercise the connection to the Mount Hua Sect as an authority. \u2018Ugh, master is so\u2026 Ju Seo Cheon let out a sigh inwardly. He had learned how to rest but his upright nature was still the same. \u2018He could just say that he is tired and no one would approach him anymore\u2026 Ju Seo Cheon was worried about him but Yu Jong Mok only smiled softly and faced the people. But the fortunate thing is that his master knew how to differentiate between an honest and dishonest man so he wasnt treated as a pushover or get into any sort of owing debt or favor He showed great proficiency at not accepting gifts or accepting them at a moderate line. At the peak of the Lotus Peak was the Shang Palace. It was a structure that existed since the beginning of Mount Hua Sect and it hadnt changed once throughout its long history. They had called the best architects to structure it and a considerable amount of effort, time and money was spent into maintaining it. That place was that important. The landscape you could see of Mount Hua from Shang Temple was such a grand and beautiful sight that everyone would drop their jaws looking at it. Its reputation was so amazing that elegant people would dream of it at least once. Besides the scenery, the palace itself was also really incredible. It was obvious as they had spent an astronomical amount of money by calling the best architects, even though that happened a long time ago. Its perfect structure was one thing and its outer appearance was also outstanding. They didnt have the same power as the emperor so they made it look poorer than the golden palace but it was still one of the best structures in the midlands. Yu Jong Mok, I knew he would be able to accomplish it. Inside the temple, an old man with a flashing white beard was sitting in front of the top seat, and laughed in a good mood. There were a hundred experts below this old man. Those people were called the Hundred Experts. Most of them were composed by pinnacle experts and there were also some Trasncendent Realm Experts among them. Did that mean that the peak of Murim was the Hundred Experts? No. There were beings that were above Transcendents and had surpassed the limits of humans and received awe and respect. They were the Heavenly Ten Seats. The Hundred Experts were always under the sky. There is always someone flying above the one that was running. There were ten absolute experts above the sky. And they were called the Heavenly Ten Seats. The old man that was sitting at the top seat was one of those people. The Sword Master and wise man Woo il Moon. The master of Mount Hua Sect! If it wasnt for his weak constitution he would have already become a Plum Blossom Sword Examiner. its really regretful. Middle aged men were sitting at the sides of Woo il Moon. They were the aides of the leader of Mount Hua, the Five Elders that had the most authority after the leader. Hm, I heard that his weak constitution got better after he reached the pinnacle rank\u2026 Oh. Woo il Moon showed interest. Yu Jong Mok was a peak expert but he wasnt considered as a proper force until now. It was because of his weak constitution. That wasnt a bad thing. He had a good personality, was so hard working he was called as a cold blooded person and had quite the talent. But he lacked endurance due to his weak constitution so he didnt receive proper tasks. Hm, how about examining him once again? In the position of Mount Hua Sect, leaving Yu Jong Mok aside was just like letting a talent rot. A wise decision. The future changed once again. After that, Yu Jong Mok was mentioned while a meeting was taking place in the Shang Temple. This meeting that was opened by the leader and the Five Elders was nominally and virtually the best meeting held in Mount Hua. The matter of what to do with a pinnacle expert was enough to enter in the meeting of the Shang Temple. And about fifteen days later. After consuming the Water Spirit Fruit, Yu Jong Mok didnt cough even once since fifteen days passed after the meeting in the Shang Temple ended. The chief executives came to the conclusion that Yu Jong Moks weak constitution was completely healed. They called him and gave him a new task. And that was making an appearance in Kang Ho. Oh, my god. Something really unprecedented had happened. After Ju Seo Cheon became Yu Jong Moks disciple, there has never been a time that he went out to Kang Ho besides friendly matters.

What happened in the past again? In his past life, when he was ten years old, he focused on training his martial arts by going and returning from the Nak An Hell. He didnt have the leisure to put attention on other things. Most of all, that was something from before the age of war. He had almost no information about that. The things Ju Seo Cheon knew about were mostly related to the age of war. And it also started from the battle of Hansam. The things that happened before that were really trivial things and the things he knew about that were also few. Hahaha, I dont know how long its been since I received a mission. Yu Jong Mok smiled in a really good mood regardless of his disciples anxiousness. Ju Seo Cheon wanted to say something while stamping his feet anxiously but he couldnt do so. It was because he knew better than anyone else how Yu Jong Mok was feeling. He had been excluded from missions even though he had the skills. Even if he did receive some missions, those were short term ones or comparatively easy ones. Long term missions required a lot of endurance. In case of urgent missions, he wouldnt be able to do anything if the body of his temperature raised suddenly. Thats why Yu Jong Mok was left out in various missions even though he was strong and regretted this situation. At one point he got depressed saying that he couldnt pay off his debt. So how would he be able to stop his master? Even if he was worried, he wasnt in a position to stop him. What mission is it? Ju Seo Cheon looked at Yu Jong Mok worriedly and asked. And then, Yu Jong Mok made a comfortable smile and crouched down to be at the same eye level as his disciple. Dont worry too much. Your master is not going out to die. I did fix this weak body of mine, but they didnt entrust a great mission to me as they werent certain of it. His body had been repaired as he reached the pinnacle rank but they werent able to entrust him with important tasks. Yu Jong Mok didnt have any performances yet but still had the record of having a frail body so they werent able to thim. Yu Jong Mok also knew that fact so he didnt feel bad. The chief executives of Mount Hua Sect decided to entrust Yu Jong Mok with an intermediate difficulty to test him. I understand. I will pray for you to return safely. Ju Seo Cheon sent off Yu Jong Mok with a half worried and half happy heart. A great change would come to Ju Seo Cheon when he turned ten. Ah, I already put up your name on the Lotus Peak examination so be prepared for it. If its you, you would probably be able to do it. Cough, cough. He started to cough as soon as he heard the name Lotus Peak. \u2018No, why? It would be good to spend his childhood without attracting too much attention. That would be the best way to spend the rest of his days as a child. But why the Lotus Peak! The Lotus Peak is a place where all the talents of Mount Hua gathered at. It is an institution where Mount Hua and even Murim pay attention to. it was obvious to attract attention as most Plum Blossom Examiners came out from this place. I dont know how long this mission will take, but there are not many people that would take care of you if you got out to Kang Ho. If you enter the Lotus Peak you wont have to worry about such things. No, they will be able to teach you better than this master of yours. Thats not the case! Hahaha, I always tell you this but you have the tendency to praise me more than necessary. Whatever the case, I believe you will be able to plentily enter the Lotus Peak. Ah, dont feel too burdened by it. Its fine if you fall out. He got crazily burdened by it. Affectionate eyes. And the emotions that were felt in those eyes was \u2018trust. If it was his disciple, he would be easily able to enter the Lotus Peak. He was sure that there was no reason at all for his disciple to fall on the examination. It wasnt excessive for Yu Jong Mok to think like that. Ju Seo Cheon had skills to back it up. Okay, I will leave now. Ju Seo Cheon was about to put on a teary face but he didnt want to worry Yu Jong Mok, that was too weak when it came to his disciple, so he smiled brightly and sent him off smiling. Four days later. Ah, fuck it. Ju Seo Cheon pulled out his hair and screamed. Just what do I have to do? Ju Seo Cheon shed tears of blood at the problem his master left him. He wasnt able to sleep properly these past four days due to the examination of the Lotus Peak. Thinking about it rationally he had to fail on the examination. If he passed the exam he would receive attention and it would become bothersome. There was no need to worry about the Purple Haze Arts getting discovered but there were still other bothersome things. But his emotions were headed in a completely different direction. \u2018Are you planning to betray the trust of your master! His master, Yu Jong Mok, was a God. His God said that he believed in him so it was hard to ignore that expectation. He wanted to fulfill his expectations by entering the Lotus Peak. \u2018Ha. I really wanted to enter that place in my past life but Im now wondering whether to enter or not! The Lotus Peak. His chest trembled just by hearing that name. The Lotus Peak was a sacred place for the inner disciples. Entering that place meant that they were evaluated as the hope of Mount Hua Sect. It also meant getting closer to becoming a Plum Blossom Examiner, that was the idols of the disciples of Mount Hua so it could only be a holy place for them. Ju Seo Cheon also admired the Lotus Peak before he returned in time. It was an institution that all the disciples of Mount Hua Sect admired. Ju Seo Cheon had dreamed of living a better life since having returned in time. It would be a lie if he said that he didnt feel any emotions. Ju Seo Cheon went to practice the Plum Blossom Sword Arts in a secluded area, this was to help in organizing his thoughts. Besides that, he also trained in the Fourteen Stances of the Plum Blossom Sword, the Withered Flower Sword Art and the Universe Sword Art that not even Yu Jong Mok was able to learn. He also wanted to train in the Purple Haze Sword Wave but that was something he could only do after he reached the fourth star in the Purple Haze Arts. \u2018Actually, im already receiving attention\u2026 Not everyone could become pinnacle experts. Most of all Yu Jong Mok had become a candidate for the Plum Blossom Sword Examiner. That alone was enough to get recognized. Because of this Yu Jong Mok was quite well known inside the Hua Sect, although he wasnt that known outside of Kang Ho. Some of his prestige disappeared after Ju Seo Cheon became his disciple but that appeared once again after he became a pinnacle expert. After Yu Jong Mok became a famous person, stories about his disciple also spread. It even spread to the visitors or disciples that wanted to form a connection with Yu Jong Mok. He couldnt easily make a conclusion because he couldnt choose between following his mind or heart. My head already hurts because of the Three Eyed Immoral God\u2026. huh? The Lotus Peak, avoiding attention, and the treasury of the Three Eyed Immoral God. These three factors lined up and arranged a new list of information. After sweating a bit by practicing in swordsmanship, he put his feet in the waters of the ravine and organized the thoughts that appeared in his head. The day the treasury of the Three Eyed Immoral God would open was five years later. He would have to go out to Kang Ho a year or two later anyways. He didnt know exactly how many treasures there were in the treasury but he did know that it wasnt few. He would need at least a year to move and hide all of that. He may have to receive the help of another person but he also needed at least two years to get someone he could trust. It would at least take one year or two. So, he would have to go out to Kang Ho when he was thirteen. He felt troubled because he didnt know how he should act next but a thought had entered his head You stupid bastard! Ju Seo Cheon blamed his dull head and got angry. He felt that the time he spent thinking until now was for nothing. If I want to go out to Kang Ho when Im thirteen, normal methods arent going to work anyways. Even if I request that to my master not even he would be able to receive permission if it wasnt reasonable enough. No, in the first place he didnt even know what he should ask his master to receive help. But there was a way that could solve this painstaking matter. It was a really simple method. The reason the disciples of Mount Hua were sent off after they became twenty years old was simple. It was because they didnt want the disciples they raised to die because they didnt have enough skills. But of course, they didnt only send off the fourth generation disciples to Kang Ho. They put skilled third generation disciples as their protectors. But you couldnt know what could happen to one person. No, what could happen in Kangho. They didnt know what variable was there. Thats why they evaluate your martial prowess to make sure its enough to survive that variable. \u2018The treasury of the Three Eyed Immoral God and attracting attention. Theres nothing to speak about if we put these two on a scale. The treasury comes first. The worth of the treasury was astronomical and the uses for the treasures in that treasury were endless. First would be the miraculous medicine. What Ju Seo Cheon lacked was internal energy so if he solved that, achieving the same prowess he had in his past life would only be a matter of time. The second were the manuals and weapons. These two would be used to gather people that would fight with him in the era of war. Besides that, he could also use them as bait so it would be good to take them. \u2018Lets keep an appropriate line to not attract too much attention. Im young anyways so they wont be that wary of me. I will only show enough skills to enter the Lotus Peak. His head spun quickly. He had thought of the big picture. Its only a fraction but he had set up a considerable frame. Whew. Even though I obtained a new life I still feel as if Ive made no progress. A sigh came out of Ju Seo Cheons mouth by its own. The things you know are for nothing. You dont even know how to use them properly. Reflect on it Ju Seo Cheon. Ju Seo Cheon hit his own head and got a hold of himself. He was certainly a steps ahead of others but that was it. He didnt know if he would be able to act properly on variables. In the first place, the person called Ju Seo Cheon wasnt that capable. He had merely followed the teachings of Mount Hua Sect. He was only accustomed to receiving orders. If someone asked him if he was wise, he wouldnt know how to answer. He barely reached the pinnacle rank by staying alive and luck followed him when he was on deaths bed that he was able to become an Unrestrained Realm Expert. That was everything. He wasnt anything. He was just a commoner. He wasnt outstanding but didnt fall behind either. It was only that. Ju Seo Cheon reminded himself of that. In the first place, if he was so wise as to be able to bring good results with a little bit of thinking, he would have been recognized by everyone even in his past life and become a proper elder. If we were to talk about the good points Ju Seo Cheon had, it was that he knew discretion. Thanks to that he somehow stayed alive during the era of war. The time I have left is three years. I will get great results at the entrance test of the Lotus Peak that will take place this year. I will then nag my master somehow and force him to let me leave for Kang Ho. Working hard doesnt go mix well with me, but I cant do anything about it. Three years. The time limit was until he reached thirteen. Ju Seo Cheon decided to bet everything. Entering the Lotus Peak! Appearing in Kang Ho! And the treasury of the Three Eyed Immoral God! He remembered these three things. This translation belongs to Centinni.

It was because they didnt want the disciples they raised to die because they didnt have enough skills. But of course, they didnt only send off the fourth generation disciples to Kang Ho. They put skilled third generation disciples as their protectors. But you couldnt know what could happen to one person. No, what could happen in Kangho. They didnt know what variable was there. Thats why they evaluate your martial prowess to make sure its enough to survive that variable. \u2018The treasury of the Three Eyed Immoral God and attracting attention. Theres nothing to speak about if we put these two on a scale. The treasury comes first. The worth of the treasury was astronomical and the uses for the treasures in that treasury were endless. First would be the miraculous medicine. What Ju Seo Cheon lacked was internal energy so if he solved that, achieving the same prowess he had in his past life would only be a matter of time. The second were the manuals and weapons. These two would be used to gather people that would fight with him in the era of war. Besides that, he could also use them as bait so it would be good to take them. \u2018Lets keep an appropriate line to not attract too much attention. Im young anyways so they wont be that wary of me. I will only show enough skills to enter the Lotus Peak. His head spun quickly. He had thought of the big picture. Its only a fraction but he had set up a considerable frame. Whew. Even though I obtained a new life I still feel as if Ive made no progress. A sigh came out of Ju Seo Cheons mouth by its own. The things you know are for nothing. You dont even know how to use them properly. Reflect on it Ju Seo Cheon. Ju Seo Cheon hit his own head and got a hold of himself. He was certainly a steps ahead of others but that was it. He didnt know if he would be able to act properly on variables. In the first place, the person called Ju Seo Cheon wasnt that capable. He had merely followed the teachings of Mount Hua Sect. He was only accustomed to receiving orders. If someone asked him if he was wise, he wouldnt know how to answer. He barely reached the pinnacle rank by staying alive and luck followed him when he was on deaths bed that he was able to become an Unrestrained Realm Expert. That was everything. He wasnt anything. He was just a commoner. He wasnt outstanding but didnt fall behind either. It was only that. Ju Seo Cheon reminded himself of that. In the first place, if he was so wise as to be able to bring good results with a little bit of thinking, he would have been recognized by everyone even in his past life and become a proper elder. If we were to talk about the good points Ju Seo Cheon had, it was that he knew discretion. Thanks to that he somehow stayed alive during the era of war. The time I have left is three years. I will get great results at the entrance test of the Lotus Peak that will take place this year. I will then nag my master somehow and force him to let me leave for Kang Ho. Working hard doesnt go mix well with me, but I cant do anything about it. Three years. The time limit was until he reached thirteen. Ju Seo Cheon decided to bet everything. Entering the Lotus Peak! Appearing in Kang Ho! And the treasury of the Three Eyed Immoral God! He remembered these three things. This translation belongs to Centinni.

The evaluation was divided into two parts. It was intelligence and literacy. In the case of intelligence, it wasnt a hard thing. In the first place, it was because they were evaluating a minor. What would they hope for a minor in the first place? The most important thing in martial arts wasnt intelligence, but martial arts. Mumble mumble. Ugh, my teeth hurt. Hmph, they are all trash. Above the prepared drill hall of the Lotus Peak. This place was bustling with disciples that were between six and twelve and they amounted to a hundred of them. All of these kids were young martial artists that would challenge the examination. It was noisy precisely because they were young and the reactions were varied too. Some felt like crying because of excessive tension, they got hard like rock, or others even checked their surroundings because they were on edge. Ju Seo Cheon took place in a corner that wouldnt attract attention and waited for his turn. Who is that? No clue. Ju Seo Cheon received unwanted attention while he was waiting for his turn. Isnt he a bit old to challenge the evaluation? He had grown unnoticeable fast thanks to the cliff climbing and internal energy. He seemed like a fourteen year old kid even though he was only ten. Maybe it was because of that they spoke between them that Ju Seo Cheon wasnt fit to be evaluated. Why worry about him? He wont pass anyways. Someone snorted. It was a clear ridicule. I already investigated everyone that could become competitors. Looking that hes not in my memories, hes not someone great. You were able to get reexamination in the Lotus Peak if you were at the adequate age. Adulthood in the Midlands was at fifteen years old. Even if you entered at fourteen years old, several benefits followed it. There was nothing to say about the honor of being a graduate of the Lotus Peak, and most of all you could receive outstanding training that was on another level. It didnt matter even if that period was one year. Because of this, people preparing to enter the Lotus Peak were abundant and their effort was also incredible. The evaluation changed every year but because many of them failed at the test, they investigated each other thoroughly. It was to find a method that would let them win against others, even if it was by a little. Whatever the case, the person called Ju Seo Cheon wasnt in their investigations. Part of it was because he didnt get along with others but also because he started to receive attention just recently. Wait. Someone recognized Ju Seo Cheon. That face, I saw it a short while ago\u2026Ah right. Hes the disciple of the Smiling Gentle Sword. A while ago several visitors went to find Yu Jong Mok to congratulate him and there were some even inside Mount Hua Sect. It seemed like there was a disciple related to those visitors. Some kids mumbled at the name of Smiling Gentle Sword. Hmph! A high nosed kid snorted. His prestige became high recently but I have never heard that his disciple was special! \u2018Mm, good. I will just let it slide. He was planning to crush them right here if they spoke bad about their master even by a little but he let it pass as it was a compliment. He didnt feel bad either. It will be better to move a little bit more rather than pay attention to that guy! Right, its just like you said. Lets go. The two kids that liked to speak left. Hm, they are all kids that will fail the test. I will be able to enter easily with no effort. Ju Seo Cheon laughed after getting relieved. Exactly one year later, the fourth generation disciples despaired in front of the examination. No, im doomed! Screams filled everywhere. Even the disciples that had sneered at Ju Seo Cheon before the examination began looked pale. How do we defeat her? Some kids lost their will to fight even before trying. I knew that a genius would appear some day\u2026 But who would have thought that day was today! A child that was next to him despaired and walked away without strength while dropping his shoulders. Next! The examiner nominated the next disciples waiting for their turn. But most of them returned without strength. Hoo. Ju Seo Cheon also looked at the examination stage with a surprised look. There was a young girl standing in the middle of the stage, in front of the examiner. \u2018Nak Seo Wol! A fourth generation disciple that was a year younger than Ju Seo Cheon. She was also a famous being in Mount Hua Sect. Information about Nak Seo Wol passed in Ju Seo Cheons head. It was because she was such a great figure even in his previous life that remained in his memories. \u2018The Plum Blossom Sword Peak\u2026! The Plum Blossom Sword Peak, Nak Seo Wol. She was a descendant of the Iron Plum Sword, one of the only women among the current Five Elders. Their relationship of master and disciple was already something not normal, but the girl herself was a great figure that shouldnt be ignored. She didnt have a talent to shake an entire generation but she still showed great talent since she was young. With her talent, effort and having one of the Five Elders as her ancestor, her future was no different from being secured. In his past life, Nak Seo Wol grew up at an overwhelming pace and became a Plum Blossom Examiner. After that, she got recognized to the point she received the nickname of \u2018Predator\u2018. That was one of the best even among the latter levels of the Righteous Faction in Murin. However, she was also called as the unhappy beauty. After the era of war opened up, Nak Seo Wol achieved great merits and became a hero but died without even becoming thirty. Her power was something else and when she turns at the marriageable age she becomes one of the best beauties of Murim. One of the heroes Ju Seo Cheon chased the back of. One of those people was the Plum Blossom Sword Peak Nak Seo Wol. Ha, they are so unlucky\u2026 they tried to get examined as if they were taking a stroll. There was no one that could threaten them among the other disciples. Excluding one person, Nak Seo Wol. Next! But. It didnt mean that there were no challengers at all. There were some that this examination was the last one for them. They climbed the examination stage and challenged Nak Seo Wol so their efforts until now werent in vain. Cheeeng! Aghh! Every time Nak Seo Wol swung her sword, the challengers fell off like leaves. It was an obvious thing. Some examiners clicked their tongues and shook their head sideways. It seemed like they didnt need to see anymore. Nak Seo Wol was the granddaughter of one of the Five Elders. She had received the outstanding teachings of her master in martial arts. Her talent was added on top of that so victory and defeat was obvious. The various feelings like nervousness, hope and passion had disappeared. They only saw despair. The level of the challengers wasnt level at all. All of the fourth generation disciples in this place were at the upper levels. The Lotus Peak was an association of the elites before they became adults. The level of the challengers also increased naturally precisely because it was a place where only talents gathered at. It was just that their opponent was bad. They say that the roots of heroes are different\u2026 Ju Seo Cheon feigned laughter and stood from his place. Next! The examiner checked his surroundings and raised his voice but no one stepped up. This year is over\u2026But we still have the next year\u2026 Shes also young\u2026Why did it have to be this year\u2026! Resignation and despairing sighs came out from everywhere. It seemed like the examination ended like this this year. Im still here. But someone completely unexpected appeared. \u2018Hes the disciple of the Smiling Gentle Sword. The examiner recognized Ju Seo Cheon. That stupid fool! The fourth generation disciple that had laughed at Ju Seo Cheon half an hour ago laughed as if it was absurd. It was a clear ridicule. Victory and defeat was already decided. There were no challengers that could defeat Nak Seo Wol in this place. No, precisely speaking rather than victory or defeat it was a matter of how long they could endure. On top of that, Ju Seo Cheons name wasnt even on the list of challengers that they should be aware of. In reality, most of the examiners felt doubts. Is he crazy because he wants to suffer embarrassment? No, he doesnt have any thoughts at all. He is able to act that courageously because he doesnt know about Nak Seo Wol. The surroundings started to mumble once again. May I start? Ju Seo Cheon asked the examiner. And the examiner nodded instead of replying. I will be in your care. Nak Seo Wol greeted him with manners. The manners were engraved in her body even though she was only nine years old. Ju Seo Cheon nodded at Nak Seo Wols greeting and bent down his knees in preparation to start right away. He put strength in his hands holding the sword and looked at his front. There were no changes in his expression. Nak Seo Wol looked at Ju Seo Cheon as if it was mysterious. Its the first time I see someone have a calm expression while looking at me. I should be the one asking why you are so mature when you are only nine. Ju Seo Cheon laughed in spite of himself at the absurdness. He marveled at the manners engraved in her body but he was more surprised at how she spoke calmly and precisely like that. In addition all kids regardless of gender tend to be naive and simple but he couldnt feel that from Nak Seo Wol at all. Its more marvelous the more I see. You look like an old man when you are speaking. Really? Actually, he wasnt just an old man, he was a geezer . I will let you attack first. Nak Seo Wol acted in a relaxed manner. Thank you. Ju Seo Cheon smirked with a bright expression. \u2018If possible, I have to enter the Lotus Peak without attracting attention. The aftereffects of when he won would be extraordinary because of who his opponent was. If that happened he could become famous even outside of Kang Ho. But he wasnt able to get defeated either. It was because he wasnt sure if he would be able to pass or not. If that was the case, he had to make it look that he had struggled to win rather than showing an overwhelming difference in skills. \u2018Why did it have to turn out like this? If it wasnt Nak Seo Wol, and if it was any other genius, he would be able to pass the evaluation without much suspicions by regulating his skills. But Nak Seo Wol, a top genius, had to appear so his head couldnt help but hurt. I have the method of waiting one year, but I dont have the time. Okay, I will go then. Ju Seo Cheon moved the flow of his internal energy to his feet. It will end in three seconds. One of the examiners mumbled. The reaction for the other viewers was the same. Everyone thought that way. However\u2026 Huup! He took in a breath and put strength in his body. The tender muscles of his thighs contracted and then swelled up. Ju Seo Cheon threw himself by swinging his legs as if he was pushing away the ground. Paat! Ju Seo Cheon arrived in front of Nak Seo Wol in an instant. Nak Seo Wol only blinked at the unexpected speed of her opponent. The viewers also got surprised. The examiners, that were especially bored, started to have their expressions change.

Nak Seo Wol raised her sword in a hurry and blocked it. Cheeng! Tremble. \u2018What an amazing internal energy! Nak Seo Wols thin wrists trembled. Ju Seo Cheon looked old but he was still a kid. It wasnt possible for a kid to have this much pure strength. Then, it meant that he had the power of internal energy. Nak Seo Wol regretted letting Ju Seo Cheon act first and made her next move. She used some footwork to retreat quickly. \u2018Calm down. The moment she took a few steps back, Nak Seo Wons head spun at a fast speed and planned her next move. \u2018I dont know how he managed to accumulate this much internal energy, but thats not the important thing here. Nak Seo Wol was young but her way of thinking was close to that of an adult. She was one of those so called geniuses. It was hard to see her as a nine year old kid because of her comprehension in martial arts, situation judgement, and knowledge. Most of all, her strongest point was that she could think of several variables even in the short instant where they exchanged blows. \u2018I should think how he will attack after that\u2026. The Universe Sword Art ,Withered Flower Sword Art, Plum Blossom Brilliant Sword Art, Five Elements Plum Blossom Sword Art and the Fourteen Stances of the Plum Blossom Sword. Those were the martial arts her opponent of that age could learn. She didnt know exactly what he trained on but she was sure he would attack her with one of those sword arts. Nak Seo Wol knew about these five sword arts and drew a picture on how to react against that. However\u2026 \u2026. . What? All her plans crumbled in that short moment. Nothing fit with what she devised. He hadnt used any top ranked martial arts. No, it wasnt martial arts in the first place. Take this! Ju Seo Cheon yelled energetically and swung his sword. He only swung his sword. He didnt even use the Plum Blossom Sword Art. He simply swung his sword randomly. It didnt have any form or shape. A line was drawn from the top left to the bottom right. It wasnt even an art. What\u2026. ! She got astounded. Nak Seo Wol was able to consider several situations in a short instant but that was also her shortcoming. Putting in badly, she thought too much unnecessarily and she got flustered if something besides her fixed concepts came flying towards her. When Ju Seo Cheon swung his sword in a way that was embarrassing to call it swordsmanship, Nak Seo Wol barely managed to block it and put a dumbfounded expression. Here I go again! Ju Seo Cheon yelled. He brought up internal energy from his lower dantian and utilized it. Pabababat! His body received the internal energy and moved quickly. His muscles that got well trained due to the cliff climbing exerted strength. Everytime he swung his sword, a heavy slashing sound rang out. The ground split and he aimed at Nak Seo Wol. But that also wasnt swordsmanship. It was only a swing. Cheeng! The two swords clashed against each other and fired off sparks. Nak Seo Wol let out a scream. The shock that was transmitted from her sword to her hand wasnt small at all. Hap! Swuuuung! A heavy sound that followed the yell. Nak Seo Woll raised her sword and blocked Ju Seo Cheons sword. Chechechecheng! Attack and defense continued repeatedly. Ju Seo Cheon pushed her back ignorantly with his internal energy and swung his sword randomly. But Nak Seo Wol blocked all of that. She got bewildered at first but was somehow able to block it thanks to her genius like talent and reflexes. His sword was irregular but it didnt mean that it couldnt be blocked. It was the opposite. It was easier to do so. His movements were so simple and didnt draw a particular sword line so it was warning her beforehand how it will strike. It was like a kid that didnt know anything was swinging his sword randomly. It gave that feeling. Kyaak! The last scream came out from her. She could clearly see the sword path. It was so obvious it made her yawn and she would be able to dodge it with her eyes closed. But that was merely when they were speaking in the sword path. The strength and speed behind that sword was incredible. Even if she was able to expect the path of the sword, that became meaningless if her body wasnt able to follow it. That was a really overwhelming and ignorant internal energy! In the end, the one that raised the white flag in front of that strength was Nak Seo Wol. I\u2026lost\u2026 Nak Seo Wol dropped her sword and she didnt look bright. The leisure she showed just a while ago was nowhere to be seen. Winner, Ju Seo Cheon! The examiner raised the hand of the winner and notified the end of the examination. But their expressions werent that good. What is that! Where did he come from! Booing sounds were heard everywhere. It was towards the winner Ju Seo Cheon, and not the loser Nak Seo Wol. You want us to recognize that? Hes worse than a third rank! Are you even a disciple of Mount Hua! The Mount Hua Sect. No, the Righteous Faction took more importance in honor rather than death. In the case of Mount Hua Sect, they were even stricter with situations of the sword. If they followed that thought and concept, it was obvious that they would curse and jeer at Ju Seo Cheon even though he was the winner. This place was none other than the Lotus Peak, a place that boasted of its everlasting history. He had won in a way that was embarrassing to call as martial arts, not to even mention being swordsmanship. Even if it wasnt rolling on the floor, throw dirt or using underhanded tactics, it was still insulting enough. \u2018Well, I already expected it. Ju Seo Cheon let the jeers and curses flow out. \u2018Being too strong is also a problem. It wasnt only Nak Seo Wols will but also his own will. It would be hard to defeat a martial artist like Nak Seo Wol with ordinary methods. He had to use the Plum Blossom Sword Art and show his martial prowess. But if he did that, she would become too strong. No matter how weak he pretended to be, his body that got strengthened with the enhancement gymnastics was the problem. In addition he also had overwhelming internal energy so he could easily surpass a third rate martial artist with just the basics of the Plum Blossom Sword Art. He could already imagine the examiners reporting this to the Five Leaders and the sect leader with their mouths hanging wide open. Even if that was the case, he wouldnt be able to defeat Nak Seo Wol if he lowered his skills too much. Thats why this is the method he came up with after thinking for a long time. A way to stop the rumors of him being a genius or whatnot would be if he was able to defeat nak Seo Wol dishonorably. He would win only with his body and internal energy. If he did that he would be able to hide his skills and win. Know that its shameless of you! But he had to pay the price for something else. \u2018If it wasnt for the age of war, I wouldnt be able to raise my head because of the shame. It was that he was also a member of the Righteous Faction. Originally he would obviously not allow an act like this and in the first place wouldnt even think of something like this. Thats why after the age of war ended, the Righteous Factions particular way of thinking had to change a bit. The situation in Murim wasnt quite good to stay stubborn on keeping their traditions or customs. This was also the reason why the Five Elders got to know of top ranked martial arts such as the Purple Haze Arts and the Purple Haze Sword Wave. The Righteous Faction has changed to be quite progressive saying that it was unavoidable for the continuance of the factions. The age of war changed countless things in Murim and Ju Seo Cheon was also one of the people that changed in that flow. \u2018Even if it was unavoidable, it will deal a blow to my masters honor so I dont feel really well. Ju Seo Cheon let out a sigh. The evaluation of the Lotus Peak ended but he couldnt say that it ended safely. It wasnt that there were injured or dead people but because he became the center of a controversy. It was the matter between Ju Seo Cheon and Nak Seo Wol. I dont approve it. A woman that was about fifty years old said. She had a face that looked as cold as ice. It was one of the Five Elders the Iron Plum Sword called Shim Ok Ryeon. Elder Shim. Its not that I dont understand you but shouldnt you listen to us first? An old man that fitted a small body and benevolent smile spoke. He was also one of the Five Elders. The Wise Sword, Hak Song. His rank was higher than Jang Moon In even among the second generation disciples. Its not even worth speaking about elder Hak. How can you let in someone that has insulted the sword of Mount Hua into the Lotus Peak? Shim Ok Ryeon spoke in a calm tone and stated the facts. Most of them were related to Ju Seo Cheons wrong doings and manners. Ju Seo Cheons actions werent see in a good light by the Mount Hua Sect, no even the Righteous Sects as a whole Its just like Elder Shim says. A middle aged man that was the tallest of them and was one of the people inside the Shang palace, nodded in agreement to Shim Ok Ryeons words. He was also one of the Five Elders, the master hand Jo Mu Yang. In addition the Five Elders didnt use the term fellow brother except for the ones that had the same master. It was because they prioritized the position of Elder and respected it, even though they were from the same generation. But in the case of Hak Song, he was one of the people that had the most age among his generation so he was an exception. Hohoho, dont make Elder Hak too troubled. I want to hear the story too. Woo il Moon stroke his white beard and turned his gaze away. And shouldnt we also hear the opinion of the other two? Hak Song sent a gaze of gratitude at the help. Based on a report that I heard, the disciple of the Smiling Gentle Sword consumed a miraculous medicine. Is that true? The eyes of the Elixir Maker Young Jin shone. The movements Ju Seo Cheon showed at the examination grounds. Those movements werent something a nine year old kid could make. His strength and speed came out from his internal energy. If it was that much speed you would need at least twenty years worth of internal energy. There was no way the examiners and martial artists of Mount Hua wouldnt know that and they also sent that on the report. There has also been a thorough inquiry on Ju Seo Cheon. Ju Seo Cheon mixed in some lies about the Water Spirit Fruit. He had said that in the past he had sneaked while Yu Jong Mok was away at the periodical meeting to enjoy the world and he discovered it coincidentally. If he entered the Lotus Peak, he would have one instructor stick to him and take care of him. Taking the pulse was also included in it and if that happened his vast internal energy will unavoidably get discovered. But in this case it didnt pose much of a problem. He had consumed something that didnt have an owner so it was vague to say that he was in the wrong or not. It would have been different if he had heard the rumors of the Water Spirit Fruit beforehand and he was ordered not to consume it when discovered. Thats why they just let the matter with the miraculous medicine slide. But instead, he did get punished at sneaking out when Yu Jong Mok was absent. Even if it was called a punishment, it wasnt a great deal. He merely had to take care of minor matters like cleaning for one month. We cant take out what has already entered his stomach but I still want to know what kind of effects that medicine will show. It meant that he wanted to let him in the Lotus Peak and observe him. You could already see by his nickname but Young Jin was a martial artist and at the same time a medic that made elixirs. With this there were two in favor and two against. Everyone naturally turned to look at one person. The Plum Blossom Sword King Ui Ji Gyeol. The Five Elders. In Mount Hua there were nicknames that came down from above. Just like the Archer of the Red Sea. The only one that could move others and his rank itself was a nickname. The Plum Blossom Sword King. That name was special even among the Five Elders and was also authority internationally was also strong. Let him enter. Sword King. Shim Ok Ryeons eyes trembled. Ui Ji Gyeol didnt blink even once and spoke. A thirteen year old kid has thirty years worth of internal energy. Regardless of his quality, he will be a plentiful force if we beat up the teachings into him. There will be a lot of words regarding this matter but its not to the point we cant bear it. The Five Elders had their own specialties and they were given authorities based on that. In the elite associations like the Lotus Peak or the Plum Blossom Sword Examiner, the authority of the Plum Blossom Sword King took priority. Even if there were two in favor and three against, the side the Plum Blossom Sword Examiner sided up with would be above. Clap! Woo il Moon clapped his hands and gathered the attention of everyone. Then, we will end this meeting here. The members that will be entering the Lotus Peak will be Ju Seo Cheon and Nak Seo Wol. This translation belongs to Centinni.

Nak Seo Wol raised her sword in a hurry and blocked it. Cheeng! Tremble. \u2018What an amazing internal energy! Nak Seo Wols thin wrists trembled. Ju Seo Cheon looked old but he was still a kid. It wasnt possible for a kid to have this much pure strength. Then, it meant that he had the power of internal energy. Nak Seo Wol regretted letting Ju Seo Cheon act first and made her next move. She used some footwork to retreat quickly. \u2018Calm down. The moment she took a few steps back, Nak Seo Wons head spun at a fast speed and planned her next move. \u2018I dont know how he managed to accumulate this much internal energy, but thats not the important thing here. Nak Seo Wol was young but her way of thinking was close to that of an adult. She was one of those so called geniuses. It was hard to see her as a nine year old kid because of her comprehension in martial arts, situation judgement, and knowledge. Most of all, her strongest point was that she could think of several variables even in the short instant where they exchanged blows. \u2018I should think how he will attack after that\u2026. The Universe Sword Art ,Withered Flower Sword Art, Plum Blossom Brilliant Sword Art, Five Elements Plum Blossom Sword Art and the Fourteen Stances of the Plum Blossom Sword. Those were the martial arts her opponent of that age could learn. She didnt know exactly what he trained on but she was sure he would attack her with one of those sword arts. Nak Seo Wol knew about these five sword arts and drew a picture on how to react against that. However\u2026 \u2026. . What? All her plans crumbled in that short moment. Nothing fit with what she devised. He hadnt used any top ranked martial arts. No, it wasnt martial arts in the first place. Take this! Ju Seo Cheon yelled energetically and swung his sword. He only swung his sword. He didnt even use the Plum Blossom Sword Art. He simply swung his sword randomly. It didnt have any form or shape. A line was drawn from the top left to the bottom right. It wasnt even an art. What\u2026. ! She got astounded. Nak Seo Wol was able to consider several situations in a short instant but that was also her shortcoming. Putting in badly, she thought too much unnecessarily and she got flustered if something besides her fixed concepts came flying towards her. When Ju Seo Cheon swung his sword in a way that was embarrassing to call it swordsmanship, Nak Seo Wol barely managed to block it and put a dumbfounded expression. Here I go again! Ju Seo Cheon yelled. He brought up internal energy from his lower dantian and utilized it. Pabababat! His body received the internal energy and moved quickly. His muscles that got well trained due to the cliff climbing exerted strength. Everytime he swung his sword, a heavy slashing sound rang out. The ground split and he aimed at Nak Seo Wol. But that also wasnt swordsmanship. It was only a swing. Cheeng! The two swords clashed against each other and fired off sparks. Nak Seo Wol let out a scream. The shock that was transmitted from her sword to her hand wasnt small at all. Hap! Swuuuung! A heavy sound that followed the yell. Nak Seo Woll raised her sword and blocked Ju Seo Cheons sword. Chechechecheng! Attack and defense continued repeatedly. Ju Seo Cheon pushed her back ignorantly with his internal energy and swung his sword randomly. But Nak Seo Wol blocked all of that. She got bewildered at first but was somehow able to block it thanks to her genius like talent and reflexes. His sword was irregular but it didnt mean that it couldnt be blocked. It was the opposite. It was easier to do so. His movements were so simple and didnt draw a particular sword line so it was warning her beforehand how it will strike. It was like a kid that didnt know anything was swinging his sword randomly. It gave that feeling. Kyaak! The last scream came out from her. She could clearly see the sword path. It was so obvious it made her yawn and she would be able to dodge it with her eyes closed. But that was merely when they were speaking in the sword path. The strength and speed behind that sword was incredible. Even if she was able to expect the path of the sword, that became meaningless if her body wasnt able to follow it. That was a really overwhelming and ignorant internal energy! In the end, the one that raised the white flag in front of that strength was Nak Seo Wol. I\u2026lost\u2026 Nak Seo Wol dropped her sword and she didnt look bright. The leisure she showed just a while ago was nowhere to be seen. Winner, Ju Seo Cheon! The examiner raised the hand of the winner and notified the end of the examination. But their expressions werent that good. What is that! Where did he come from! Booing sounds were heard everywhere. It was towards the winner Ju Seo Cheon, and not the loser Nak Seo Wol. You want us to recognize that? Hes worse than a third rank! Are you even a disciple of Mount Hua! The Mount Hua Sect. No, the Righteous Faction took more importance in honor rather than death. In the case of Mount Hua Sect, they were even stricter with situations of the sword. If they followed that thought and concept, it was obvious that they would curse and jeer at Ju Seo Cheon even though he was the winner. This place was none other than the Lotus Peak, a place that boasted of its everlasting history. He had won in a way that was embarrassing to call as martial arts, not to even mention being swordsmanship. Even if it wasnt rolling on the floor, throw dirt or using underhanded tactics, it was still insulting enough. \u2018Well, I already expected it. Ju Seo Cheon let the jeers and curses flow out. \u2018Being too strong is also a problem. It wasnt only Nak Seo Wols will but also his own will. It would be hard to defeat a martial artist like Nak Seo Wol with ordinary methods. He had to use the Plum Blossom Sword Art and show his martial prowess. But if he did that, she would become too strong. No matter how weak he pretended to be, his body that got strengthened with the enhancement gymnastics was the problem. In addition he also had overwhelming internal energy so he could easily surpass a third rate martial artist with just the basics of the Plum Blossom Sword Art. He could already imagine the examiners reporting this to the Five Leaders and the sect leader with their mouths hanging wide open. Even if that was the case, he wouldnt be able to defeat Nak Seo Wol if he lowered his skills too much. Thats why this is the method he came up with after thinking for a long time. A way to stop the rumors of him being a genius or whatnot would be if he was able to defeat nak Seo Wol dishonorably. He would win only with his body and internal energy. If he did that he would be able to hide his skills and win. Know that its shameless of you! But he had to pay the price for something else. \u2018If it wasnt for the age of war, I wouldnt be able to raise my head because of the shame. It was that he was also a member of the Righteous Faction. Originally he would obviously not allow an act like this and in the first place wouldnt even think of something like this. Thats why after the age of war ended, the Righteous Factions particular way of thinking had to change a bit.

The Righteous Faction has changed to be quite progressive saying that it was unavoidable for the continuance of the factions. The age of war changed countless things in Murim and Ju Seo Cheon was also one of the people that changed in that flow. \u2018Even if it was unavoidable, it will deal a blow to my masters honor so I dont feel really well. Ju Seo Cheon let out a sigh. The evaluation of the Lotus Peak ended but he couldnt say that it ended safely. It wasnt that there were injured or dead people but because he became the center of a controversy. It was the matter between Ju Seo Cheon and Nak Seo Wol. I dont approve it.

The winter plum withered and the snow plum bloomed\u2026 then as time passed the snow plum withered and was once again replaced by one of winter A year had passed since Ju Seo Cheon started to live in the Lotus Peak. Time flowed by really quickly. He had practiced the Plum Blossom Life Arts everyday until now. Thanks to that, he accumulated forty five years worth of internal energy when he was eleven years old. The Purple Haze Arts also reached the third start. It was still a disgustingly slow pace. This wasnt something Ju Seo Cheon controlled on purpose. It was the contrary. He trained by spending quite a lot of concentration. Martial artists dont take too much time on completing an art if they focus on it. Generally one year was enough. Actually he had already completed the Five Elements Plum Blossom Sword Art. It only took a few months for the basic swordsmanship like the Universe Sword Art and the Withered Flower Sword Art. But of course, he had hidden these achievements so as to not attract any attention. Whew. Even though he could solve most of the things he achieved in the past due to the fact he had reached the unrestrained realm but the Purple Haze Arts was hard to comprehend even with prior experience in using it. He realized that it wasnt a godly art of Mount Hua for nothing. It would have been much faster if someone had taught him but he couldnt ask anyone for advice on the Purple Haze Arts so he had to solve it alone. It wasnt that the fourth generation disciples tried to spend their childhood in the Lotus Peak for nothing. It meant that the treatment was that good. The part Ju Seo Cheon liked especially was the close to free personal training. There were almost no restrictions to it. He had learned some top ranked martial arts since having come to the Lotus Peak. For the internal energy circulation, it was the Universal Plum Blossom Breathing Technique. The internal energy circulation method that represented Mount Hua Sect were divided in four. The first was the Plum Blossom Qi Arts that served as the base for everything. The second was the Universal Plum Blossom Breathing Technique and the third being the Jade Maidens Breathing Technique. The Universal Plum Blossom Breathing Technique and the Jade Maidens Breathing Technique were only allowed to the full fledged disciples and the reason for that was that they served as the roots and trunks for Mount Hua Sect. In addition, the Jade Maidens Breathing Technique was an energy circulation technique that was only made for women. Men werent able to learn it. The fourth one was the Purple Haze Arts. It was the greatest art of Mount Hua Sect. Ju Seo Cheon trained in the Plum Blossom Breathing Technique and also in the Plum Blossom Life Arts. The two techniques were things he had practiced to the point he got tired of it in his past life so he was able to complete it at a really fast speed. Besides that he learned the Fourteen Stances of the Plum Blossom Sword, pursuing arts, detoxification and other miscellaneous arts he would need in Kang Ho besides martial arts. The fourth generation disciples that had passed the evaluation received education of another level, as if to prove that this place wasnt called the Lotus Peak for nothing. Ju Seo Cheon showed the Fourteen Stances of the Plum Blossom Sword to the instructor at a suitable level and took some time for personal training. He spent most of his time sitting near the plum tree and operating the Plum Blossom Life Arts. Doing this regularly helped in accumulating internal energy. Senior Brother. After he finished circulating internal energy, he opened his eyes and saw a familiar face. Ju Seo Cheon calmed down his surprised heart and said, I will really get my internal energy run rampant and my insides will get screwed like this. The two of them entered the Lotus Peak side by side a year ago. Because of that, the repercussions it brought still reverberated until now. Im really sorry if I surprised you. Nak Seo Wol blinked and then apologized. Those werent empty words and you could feel that she was really sorry from her voice. Theres no need to apologize like that. Moreover, isnt it obvious you dont have to apologize as you are the granddaughter of that old ha\u2026no, that grandma. Nak Seo Wol was ten years old. Her mature mind and actions that didnt fit her age was still the same. She was considerate and conceded to others. In addition she received advice from her fellow comrades that were several times older than her. That wasnt something that should be seen from a ten year old kid at all. Part of it was because Nak Seo Wol wasnt normal since she was young but also because of the strict education she received from the Iron Plum Sword. Senior brother. Nak Seo Wols cheeks swelled up. Okay, I understand. Im sorry. I apologize. Ju Seo Cheon shrugged his shoulders and recognized his mistake. The Iron Plum Sword may seem like a bloodless person but that wasnt the case for her disciple. Nak Seo Wol got satisfied as Ju Seo Cheon apologized sincerely. I think that it is really good for someone to admit their mistakes. Right. Before that, you are also quite the person to want to hang out with the likes of me. Ju Seo Cheon received a nickname even before he made an appearance in Kang Ho. The flashy and frail one. It was taken from the idiom that he was externally splendid but didnt have anything inside of him. A year ago, at the examination, Ju Seo Cheon had won by swinging his sword ignorantly. At first people said that he may have used some black magic but it was resolved as Ju Seo Cheon had stumbled upon the fate of having consumed a miraculous medicine. A pig is wearing a pearl. Ugh, how did that fate go to that guy? It means that he is only lucky. The evaluation of Ju Seo Cheon decreased even more. Miraculous medicine. Having won simply with internal energy meant that his own martial prowess was terrible. In the position of the disciples that had worked hard for several years, they couldnt help but resent Ju Seo Cheon more than their fated enemies. Whatever the case, contrary to the idiom that supported his nickname of \u2018The flashy and frail one, he had flashy internal energy and terrible martial arts. It was obvious but Ju Seo Cheon didnt care about that at all. To the contrary, he was quite satisfied with having this nickname. \u2018It annoys me that Im being cursed at but it makes sense. He had entered the Lotus Peak but he was recognized as being plain. This way he would be able to evade the gazes of the enemies that would appear in the future. He regretted the way he had lived his past life and wanted to live the current one as he pleased but he had to, at least for now, keep a low profile. You know what, senior brother. Nak Seo Wol stared at Ju Seo Cheon. What? What you usually show is your original ability? Right. Ju Seo Cheon laid a plate of steel in his face and lied. Ju Seo Cheons actions, after entering the Lotus Peak, were exceptional in various meanings, and he received attention and expectations. The moment he just entered, most people didnt see him in a good way. But there were some that didnt. They thought that he may change if he was taught properly, even if he had passed the evaluation luckily with the help of a miraculous medicine. A few instructors in the Lotus Peak especially thought that way. They taught him on behalf of Yu Jong Mok, that had gone out on a mission, and taught him quite seriously even though he wasnt their disciple. But there was no way that Ju Seo Cheon would follow their expectations as he had to hide his original skills. He only showed moderate skills. And you know that elder Shim Ok Ryeon hates me. Thats why it would be better not to approach me. Ju Seo Cheon stood up from his seat. Nak Seo Wol wanted to follow him but he raised his hand and stopped her. \u2018Ugh, what a waste. He acted cool and uninterested in the outside but he wanted to return immediately and speak with Nak Seo Wol. The memories from when he first saw her remained strongly deep in his heart. She was standing at the latter levels of Murims Righteous Faction, was called as the Plum Blossom Sword peak and was courted by countless men. Their difference in skills and prestige was so big that Ju Seo Cheon only followed her back. He didnt have the courage to speak to her. That kind of person accompanied him, called out his name, smiled and held conversations together. It was enough to make him extremely happy. Nak Seo Wol became one of the peerless beauties of Murim and at the same time surged up like a hero. Ju Seo Cheon, was nothing, only being able to admire his idols and doing so until his death. Nak Seo Wol was clearly among them. Endure it a little bit more Ju Seo Cheon. But the problem was Shim Ok Ryeon. Not too much time passed since having entered the Lotus Peak, Shim Ok Ryeon showed on purpose that she didnt like Ju Seo Cheon and was wary of him. But after some time passed she discovered that Ju Seo Cheon didnt commit any accidents, nor did he have any exceptional skills and stayed silent for the most part, so she naturally put away her interest. This was the time when he should be patient. Ju Seo Cheon reminded himself of that point several times. The geniuses, talents and prodigies gathered at the Lotus Peak. There were nine members excluding Ju Seo Cheon. When Ju Seo Cheon first saw the members of the Lotus Peak, he couldnt hide his surprise even though he had known who it would be. That was because the current composition of the members was formed by people that mostly stood next to Nak Seo Wol on the battlefield. If you thought about it, it was an obvious thing. The Lotus Peak was a place where all the talents of Mount Hua Sect gathered at and were taken care of and nurtured to become exceptional If a person was particularly talented they were also provided with a top ranked martial arts or miraculous medicine. Imagining of aparting their future. A ninth of the Plum Blossom Sword Examiners, elders and leaders were graduates from the Lotus Peak. \u2018How should I express what im feeling right now? They were all people he didnt have a connection with. They all lived in a completely different world. These people didnt know the face or name of Ju Seo Cheon. That was the same even when he became an elder in his past life. \u2018Everyone that is here\u2026will disappear during the age of war. The age of war that continued for dozens of years. The force of Mount Hua Sect changed several times in that time. Starting from the Examiners, the Five Elders, and even the leader of the sect had changed due to the war. The ones that were called heroes lost their lives in exchange for peace. His fellow disciples were no exception. \u2018No, now I also dont know when I will depart. The reason Ju Seo Cheon was able to stay alive until the end in his past life was because of a bit of luck and part of his partial prowess. Most of the ones that were called as elites were sent on important missions and got designated as targets to assassinate. Most of the third and second ranked martial artists got deployed in the battlefield and disappeared. On the other hand, martial artists with a moderate level somehow protected their lives and succeeded in staying alive. But Ju Seo Cheon in this time surpassed that moderate level and entered the Lotus Peak, which was a class for geniuses, so he didnt know what would happen. \u2018Will I be able to become a hero that others would admire as well? Just as he thought that, a voice had called out to him Hey, frail guy! There was a really angry kid standing there. His eyes were fierce and he was breathing quite aggressively in an excited state. His hip bone was much bigger than the other kids and his spiky hair was quite memorable. Yes, brother Lee Geon. Lee Geon was three years older than him, a member of the Lotus Peak that would turn fourteen this year. You bastard! Lee Geon glared at Ju Seo Cheon with bloodshot eyes. The emotions that flared from those eyes was clearly jealousy. Ju Seo Cheon scratched his head as if it was troublesome and Lee Geon glared at him while walking towards him. He then grabbed his collarbone roughly with his hands that were quite frail. You dare ignore what this senior brother of yours said? Im sure I warned you not to approach Nak last time. But you still dare speak to her even though you know that!","title":"volcanic-16"},{"location":"volcanic-16/#vocanic-age-chapter-16","text":"Editor: Imagine (Note from Imagine: Sorry For the late post you guys, Enjoy!)

It was the greatest art of Mount Hua Sect. Ju Seo Cheon trained in the Plum Blossom Breathing Technique and also in the Plum Blossom Life Arts. The two techniques were things he had practiced to the point he got tired of it in his past life so he was able to complete it at a really fast speed. Besides that he learned the Fourteen Stances of the Plum Blossom Sword, pursuing arts, detoxification and other miscellaneous arts he would need in Kang Ho besides martial arts. The fourth generation disciples that had passed the evaluation received education of another level, as if to prove that this place wasnt called the Lotus Peak for nothing. Ju Seo Cheon showed the Fourteen Stances of the Plum Blossom Sword to the instructor at a suitable level and took some time for personal training. He spent most of his time sitting near the plum tree and operating the Plum Blossom Life Arts. Doing this regularly helped in accumulating internal energy. Senior Brother. After he finished circulating internal energy, he opened his eyes and saw a familiar face. Ju Seo Cheon calmed down his surprised heart and said, I will really get my internal energy run rampant and my insides will get screwed like this. The two of them entered the Lotus Peak side by side a year ago. Because of that, the repercussions it brought still reverberated until now. Im really sorry if I surprised you. Nak Seo Wol blinked and then apologized. Those werent empty words and you could feel that she was really sorry from her voice. Theres no need to apologize like that. Moreover, isnt it obvious you dont have to apologize as you are the granddaughter of that old ha\u2026no, that grandma. Nak Seo Wol was ten years old. Her mature mind and actions that didnt fit her age was still the same. She was considerate and conceded to others. In addition she received advice from her fellow comrades that were several times older than her. That wasnt something that should be seen from a ten year old kid at all. Part of it was because Nak Seo Wol wasnt normal since she was young but also because of the strict education she received from the Iron Plum Sword. Senior brother. Nak Seo Wols cheeks swelled up. Okay, I understand. Im sorry. I apologize. Ju Seo Cheon shrugged his shoulders and recognized his mistake. The Iron Plum Sword may seem like a bloodless person but that wasnt the case for her disciple. Nak Seo Wol got satisfied as Ju Seo Cheon apologized sincerely. I think that it is really good for someone to admit their mistakes. Right. Before that, you are also quite the person to want to hang out with the likes of me. Ju Seo Cheon received a nickname even before he made an appearance in Kang Ho. The flashy and frail one. It was taken from the idiom that he was externally splendid but didnt have anything inside of him. A year ago, at the examination, Ju Seo Cheon had won by swinging his sword ignorantly. At first people said that he may have used some black magic but it was resolved as Ju Seo Cheon had stumbled upon the fate of having consumed a miraculous medicine. A pig is wearing a pearl. Ugh, how did that fate go to that guy? It means that he is only lucky. The evaluation of Ju Seo Cheon decreased even more. Miraculous medicine. Having won simply with internal energy meant that his own martial prowess was terrible. In the position of the disciples that had worked hard for several years, they couldnt help but resent Ju Seo Cheon more than their fated enemies. Whatever the case, contrary to the idiom that supported his nickname of \u2018The flashy and frail one, he had flashy internal energy and terrible martial arts. It was obvious but Ju Seo Cheon didnt care about that at all. To the contrary, he was quite satisfied with having this nickname. \u2018It annoys me that Im being cursed at but it makes sense. He had entered the Lotus Peak but he was recognized as being plain. This way he would be able to evade the gazes of the enemies that would appear in the future. He regretted the way he had lived his past life and wanted to live the current one as he pleased but he had to, at least for now, keep a low profile. You know what, senior brother. Nak Seo Wol stared at Ju Seo Cheon. What? What you usually show is your original ability? Right. Ju Seo Cheon laid a plate of steel in his face and lied. Ju Seo Cheons actions, after entering the Lotus Peak, were exceptional in various meanings, and he received attention and expectations. The moment he just entered, most people didnt see him in a good way. But there were some that didnt. They thought that he may change if he was taught properly, even if he had passed the evaluation luckily with the help of a miraculous medicine. A few instructors in the Lotus Peak especially thought that way. They taught him on behalf of Yu Jong Mok, that had gone out on a mission, and taught him quite seriously even though he wasnt their disciple. But there was no way that Ju Seo Cheon would follow their expectations as he had to hide his original skills. He only showed moderate skills. And you know that elder Shim Ok Ryeon hates me. Thats why it would be better not to approach me. Ju Seo Cheon stood up from his seat. Nak Seo Wol wanted to follow him but he raised his hand and stopped her. \u2018Ugh, what a waste. He acted cool and uninterested in the outside but he wanted to return immediately and speak with Nak Seo Wol. The memories from when he first saw her remained strongly deep in his heart. She was standing at the latter levels of Murims Righteous Faction, was called as the Plum Blossom Sword peak and was courted by countless men. Their difference in skills and prestige was so big that Ju Seo Cheon only followed her back. He didnt have the courage to speak to her. That kind of person accompanied him, called out his name, smiled and held conversations together. It was enough to make him extremely happy. Nak Seo Wol became one of the peerless beauties of Murim and at the same time surged up like a hero. Ju Seo Cheon, was nothing, only being able to admire his idols and doing so until his death. Nak Seo Wol was clearly among them. Endure it a little bit more Ju Seo Cheon. But the problem was Shim Ok Ryeon. Not too much time passed since having entered the Lotus Peak, Shim Ok Ryeon showed on purpose that she didnt like Ju Seo Cheon and was wary of him. But after some time passed she discovered that Ju Seo Cheon didnt commit any accidents, nor did he have any exceptional skills and stayed silent for the most part, so she naturally put away her interest. This was the time when he should be patient. Ju Seo Cheon reminded himself of that point several times. The geniuses, talents and prodigies gathered at the Lotus Peak. There were nine members excluding Ju Seo Cheon. When Ju Seo Cheon first saw the members of the Lotus Peak, he couldnt hide his surprise even though he had known who it would be. That was because the current composition of the members was formed by people that mostly stood next to Nak Seo Wol on the battlefield. If you thought about it, it was an obvious thing. The Lotus Peak was a place where all the talents of Mount Hua Sect gathered at and were taken care of and nurtured to become exceptional If a person was particularly talented they were also provided with a top ranked martial arts or miraculous medicine. Imagining of aparting their future. A ninth of the Plum Blossom Sword Examiners, elders and leaders were graduates from the Lotus Peak. \u2018How should I express what im feeling right now? They were all people he didnt have a connection with. They all lived in a completely different world. These people didnt know the face or name of Ju Seo Cheon. That was the same even when he became an elder in his past life. \u2018Everyone that is here\u2026will disappear during the age of war. The age of war that continued for dozens of years. The force of Mount Hua Sect changed several times in that time. Starting from the Examiners, the Five Elders, and even the leader of the sect had changed due to the war. The ones that were called heroes lost their lives in exchange for peace. His fellow disciples were no exception. \u2018No, now I also dont know when I will depart. The reason Ju Seo Cheon was able to stay alive until the end in his past life was because of a bit of luck and part of his partial prowess. Most of the ones that were called as elites were sent on important missions and got designated as targets to assassinate. Most of the third and second ranked martial artists got deployed in the battlefield and disappeared. On the other hand, martial artists with a moderate level somehow protected their lives and succeeded in staying alive. But Ju Seo Cheon in this time surpassed that moderate level and entered the Lotus Peak, which was a class for geniuses, so he didnt know what would happen. \u2018Will I be able to become a hero that others would admire as well? Just as he thought that, a voice had called out to him Hey, frail guy! There was a really angry kid standing there. His eyes were fierce and he was breathing quite aggressively in an excited state. His hip bone was much bigger than the other kids and his spiky hair was quite memorable. Yes, brother Lee Geon. Lee Geon was three years older than him, a member of the Lotus Peak that would turn fourteen this year. You bastard! Lee Geon glared at Ju Seo Cheon with bloodshot eyes. The emotions that flared from those eyes was clearly jealousy. Ju Seo Cheon scratched his head as if it was troublesome and Lee Geon glared at him while walking towards him. He then grabbed his collarbone roughly with his hands that were quite frail. You dare ignore what this senior brother of yours said? Im sure I warned you not to approach Nak last time. But you still dare speak to her even though you know that!","title":"Vocanic Age Chapter 16"},{"location":"volcanic-17/","text":"Vocanic Age Chapter 17 Editor: Imagine SURPRISE DOUBLE CHAPTER (to make up for not posting on Tuesday) and to make sure i edit more and dont become a lazy ass Its a misunderstanding, fellow brother. Ju Seo Cheon put on an annoyed expression for a moment but then shook his hands and smiled bitterly. Nak Seo Wol was an exception but Ju Seo Cheon also wasnt childlike either. How will I ignore the words of my senior brother? I was just relaying a message from the instructor. Ju Seo Cheon spoke as if he was appealing. Is that true? Lee Geon asked with suspecting eyes and didnt forget to shake Ju Seo Cheon from his collar. Yes, its true. \u2026. . Hmph. Only then did he let go of his grip. Lee Geon glared at Ju Seo Cheon once and turned around. His steps indicated that he was still enraged. Hes so loud. Lee Geon didnt see Ju Seo Cheon in a good light, since the day he entered. It was because of the interest Nak Seo Wol had shown to Ju Seo Cheon. Nak Seo Wol has been famous since she entered Mount Hua Sect. Part of it was because of her talent but it was more so due to her beauty. She set the hearts of the male disciples on fire and because of that, she received stricter education on moderation and self control. Lee Geon was also one of those boys. He didnt like Ju Seo Cheon at all as Lee Geon was someone that had fallen in love with Nak Seo Wol. Thats why every time Ju Seo Cheon shared a conversation with Nak Seo Wol, he immediately noticed that and would constantly pick a fight with Ju Seo Cheon. He got angry at times because of his actions but he was able to endure it because Lee Geon didnt cross the line. Lee Geon was also dreaming of becoming a Plum Blossom Sword Examiner just like most disciples in Mount Hua. Committing a mishap inside the Lotus Peak could mean hurting his chances at becoming a Plum Blossom Sword Examiner. Maybe it was because of that worry that he didnt directly inflict any harm. If he had crossed the line, Ju Seo Cheon wouldnt have endured it and was planning to teach him a lesson but he hadnt. His relationship with the other disciples of the Lotus Peak besides lee Geon wasnt good or bad either. He just had no interaction with them. At first, he received gazes of contempt with the reason being that he had dirtied the holy place of the examinations grounds. But that was only in the beginning, after a year passed all of their gazes turned into indifference. It would have been a different story if he couldnt catch up in spars, but Ju Seo Cheon followed up well so they didnt say anything. The only one that showed dislike openly was Lee Geon. But besides that, life at the Lotus Peak was calm. He passed his days without any accidents. He spent most of his time in training martial arts, and after he trained his daily training he thought about the treasury of the Three Eyed Immoral God in his meditation. \u2018Theres not much time left. There were two years left now. He had set up his plans diligently until now, and now he only had to put them in action. \u2018When will it be. The disciples of the Lotus Peak moved faster than normal disciples in everything. The same went for going out to Kang Ho. They got to go out before they were even twenty years old. Even if their skills were lacking they would still go out with a guardian by their side in the name of accumulating experience. This was a tradition of the Lotus Peak and a way of education. It was something that would certainly happen. Ju Seo Cheon hoped for that day to come and waited patiently. There was a saying that if you looked in front it would be slow, but fast if you looked back. After getting a hold of himself, one more year had passed. Ha, there is no one that matches him at least for his internal energy. Young Jin, one of the Five Elders, finished taking the pulse and got surprised. Ju Seo Cheon was now twelve years old. He accumulated six years of internal energy everytime he practiced the Plum Blossom Life Arts for one year and thanks to that, the total amount of internal energy he had was fifty one years worth. In a little while, it would get to sixty years worth of internal energy. No other disciple of the nine factions would be able to show this much progress. You are only twelve but are close to what would normally take sixty years to reach. Fate must love you, it looks like youre quite lucky to have found that miraculous medicine . There were not many people that were interested in Ju Seo Cheon inside of Mount Hua sect. The elixir maker Young Jin was among those people. Two years ago, Young Jin had raised his hand on accepting Ju Seo Cheon saying that he would observe him. Even if he said that he would observe, there wasnt anything great about it. It was only checking the state of the body periodically. \u2018Its not thanks to the Water Spirit Fruit but the Plum Blossom Life Arts. Ju Seo Cheon smiled bitterly inwardly. Young Jin saw how Ju Seo Cheons internal energy increased exponentially with the passing days and misunderstood that it was thanks to the Water Spirit Fruit. It was obvious as he didnt know about the secret of the Plum Blossom Qi Arts. The Plum Blossom Life Arts. For you to have shared that good thing with that weakling. You are so cheap. You should have taken care of the elders of the sect first. Young Jin smacked his lips in a regretful manner. Hes not a weakling. Ha, look at how your eyes changed when I brought up your master! Young Jins tone increased. Stop teasing me. Is it that fun to tease a twelve year old kid? Ju Seo Cheon let out a sigh in a tired manner. Of course it is! Kukukuk! Young Jin was the person he had the most interaction with because he visited him to take the pulse periodically. They had become quite close in the past two years. Thats how they were able to exchange jokes like this. If you have finished taking my pulse I will be taking my leave. Said Ju Seo Cheon quite grumpily. I came with news about your master. Elder Young is the number one in Mount Hua. Ju Seo Cheon was about to stand up when he sat down again. He gathered his knees and placed his hands on top of them. Two years ago, after Yu Jong Mok went out to Kang Ho, he spent most of the time outside of Mount Hua. There was a time he returned but he received another order after a month and descended the mountain once again. Ju Seo Cheon didnt like that but he couldnt do anything about it. It was because Yu Jong Mok had all the good conveniences until now because of his weak body and it was now time to repay that debt. Its not anything amazing so ease up. Young Jin relayed about Yu Jong Moks situation with a tired expression. It really wasnt anything great. It was something like what kind of mission he was on and where he was at. As he got close to one of the Five Elders, he was able to hear news regarding his master even before he wrote his master a letter asking. That much is enough. Im always grateful to you. Ju Seo Cheon bowed deeply and expressed his gratitude. Sincerity could be seen in all of his actions. A warm smile grew on his face. That was a really cool relationship between master and disciple. Ah, and you should also start to prepare to go out. Young Jin wrote down something on a paper and spoke. Ju Seo Cheons eyes opened widely. \u2018Finally! Boom! Boom! Boom! His heart beat wildly and his breath became faster. Something got released from his brain and released heat. Young Jin didnt know what kind of reaction Ju Seo Cheon was showing and continued to speak while still looking at the piece of paper. You should also know that you are going out to Kang Ho faster than the other disciples\u2026 Young Jin explained something but he couldnt hear well. Ju Seo Cheon calmed down his excitement the most he could. \u2018Finally, the time has come. There was only one year left until the time limit so he had been really anxious. But fortunately, that anxiety came to an end now. Dispatchment to Kang Ho. These words filled up Ju Seo Cheons heart. Not everyone in the Lotus Peak got out to Kang Ho. Only a few selected members did. The priorities were set up with the time they could still spend at the Lotus Peak. All the members that hadnt been able to go out to Kang Ho before they turned fifteen were set up as priorities. After that, it was by recommendation or level of martial arts. In the case of recommendations, one needed their master or an instructor to accompany them and after that the next priority was age. Ju Seo Cheon had requested it to Yu Jong Mok through a letter. Yu Jong Mok seemed to be really worried but he agreed unavoidably as his master, that hadnt acted spoiled until now, pledged him. He would go out to Kang Ho the moment he was allowed to anyways due to the fact he was in the Lotus Peak. There was no need to hurry. In addition, disciples of the Lotus Peak that already had experience in going to Kang Ho naturally got removed from the priorities. There was no need to worry about competition. The members going out to Kang Ho were already set. Nice to meet you. I am Gu Pung, the one that will be taking care of you starting today. The Fourteenth Gallant Sword, Gu Pung. He would be the leader and protector of the dispatchment to Kang Ho this time. His skills were preeminent even among the third generation disciples. He was a pinnacle ranked expert whose reputation spread even in Kang Ho. It wasnt only his martial prowess that was high, but his generation in the clan was also high. There was no one among the third generation disciples that called Gu Pung as their fellow disciple. He was also an uncle for Ju Seo Cheon. I will check the members before we go down. Gu Pung called out the chicks in front of him. Jang Hong, Jang Seo Eun, Ju Seo Cheon. Yes! The three of them answered at the same time and their voice was filled with strength. Gu Pung smiled bitterly at this and then patted the shoulders of the three people and spoke in a soft tone. We are not going to die anywhere, theres no need to be that nervous. We are merely descending Mount Hua. The hard atmosphere became soft. Now, lets go. Gu Pung took the front and they followed his back. \u2018Fellow disciple Jang Hong and Jang Seo Eun. Ju Seo Cheon stood at the back of the line and looked at the boy and girl in front of him. The two of them had faces filled with expectation and nervousness. Jang Hong was fourteen years old and among those his age and generation he was peerless. Jang Seo Eun was thirteen and was also the sister of Jang Hong. Ju Seo Cheon got relieved when he heard that these two brothers would accompany him. Their relationship in the Lotus Peak wasnt that bad. It didnt mean that they saw him in a good light, but they didnt despise him either. In other words, they were apathetic. Nak Seo Wol had said that she wanted to follow him but she gave up because she was aware of Shim Ok Ryeon, who didnt see him in a good light. Senior uncle, Im curious about something, may I ask about it? Ju Seo Cheon asked Gu Pung. Ask whatever you want. What is our destination? We will advance southward to cross Chongqing and get to Guizhou. Gui\u2026 Guizhou? Jang Seo Eun asked with a tense face. Right. Thats the boundary between the Righteous Faction and the Death Faction. Guizhou was a place where battles never stopped. It was because the influences of the forces of the Righteous and Death Faction were split in half. They fighted endlessly to try to expand that force even by a little. Dozens of scuffles occurred even when they were in a state of ceasefire. It was the so-called region in dispute. And at Guizhou, fights that werent wars also occurred so huge factions sent their disciples over there to make them accumulate experience. I told you this before but you are not going to die so dont worry. Im here with you and Guizhou is filled with experts of the Righteous Faction as much as it is a dangerous place so you wont get hurt or die. A martial artist appearing in Kang Ho meant that they would use the martial arts they had learned until now to use it in real battles and accumulate experience. It looked like they had come to sight see but that wasnt the case at all. \u2018Chongqing! Jang Hong and Jang Seo Eun were really nervous at the fact that they were going to Guizhou but that wasnt the case for Ju Seo Cheon. What was important to him wasnt Guizhou but Chongqing. The thing he was finding for so long was hidden there. \u2018The treasury of the Three Eyed Immoral God!","title":"volcanic-17"},{"location":"volcanic-17/#vocanic-age-chapter-17","text":"Editor: Imagine SURPRISE DOUBLE CHAPTER (to make up for not posting on Tuesday) and to make sure i edit more and dont become a lazy ass Its a misunderstanding, fellow brother.

The thing he was finding for so long was hidden there. \u2018The treasury of the Three Eyed Immoral God!","title":"Vocanic Age Chapter 17"},{"location":"volcanic-18/","text":"Vocanic Age Chapter 18 Translator: Subak Editor: Summerstood, Imagine Hubei at the east, Sichuan at the west, Guizhou at the south and Shaanxi at the north. Chongqing was the place that was surrounded by all of these forces. And the treasury of the Three Eyed Immoral God was located here, in Chongqing. Gu Pungs group came down from Shaanxi in a straight line and after arriving at Chongqing, they continued to head south to Guizhou. Ju Seo Cheon couldnt even get near the treasury. Part of it was because of his group and also because he wouldnt be able to enter it anyways even if he did go there. It wasnt the treasury of the Three Eyed Immoral God for nothing. It contained all kinds of traps in it and Ju Seo Cheon wasnt able to break through them yet. Even if he did get through, moving that huge amount of treasures was also another problem. The Yangtze river that continued from Hubei and Chongqing, ended in Sichuan. The provinces of Chongqing were also separated by the Yangtze river. They had a path they could use to return but that would take them dozens of days. It wasnt that there was a time limit on this expedition but there was no need to do that. They headed to an estuary to take on a boat. For reference, they had to walk and even swim to reach this place. In the case of training in swimming, moving long distances for a long time was the most efficient thing to do. Usually, they just had to run in circles in a designated place as they had nowhere to train inside in Mount Hua. But compared to that, the Midlands was an open field so it was nice to run as much as they wished. They didnt ride on horses and only moved by their feet. Ho, your internal energy is amazing just like I heard. Gu pung looked at Ju Seo Cheon while they were travelling and got surprised. Ju Seo Cheon didnt show exhaustion and didnt even drip any sweat while Jang Hong or Jang Seo Eun collapsed in exhaustion. He was quite famous for the miraculous medicine so Gu Pung knew about him, but it was still marvelous as he witnessed that strength with his two eyes. An internal energy that you couldnt think of it belonging to a twelve year old kid. The overwhelming due to the fact was that he was still undergoing puberty. Its not much. I was just lucky. Senior brother and senior sister are much more impressive than beings like me. Ju Seo Cheon held out a bottle of water to the tired brothers. He lowered his posture and put himself on their eye levels. He didnt want to create unnecessary fights between the members of the Lotus Peak. The evaluation people had on him had already degraded and it couldnt sink lower so it wouldnt inflict much damage on him if he lowered his pride. And actually, those actions were a wise decision. It would hurt the pride of the sect if the disciple that was famous for being useless acted like nothing when it was this exhausting for them. Jang Hong and Jang Seo Eun didnt have a bad personality or werent narrow minded but they were still kids in the end. Even if they were wiser than normal disciples, it wasnt at a level where they could understand everything and embrace it. His seventy years of experience hadnt disappeared. Even if he was lacking compared to others, he had experience that was above them. When they arrived at the estuary they were able to see skiffs lined up infinitely. The place was also filled with people that had come to see the Yangtze river, maybe because the sun was at its peak. As the group got near the estuary, the ship owners wearing bamboo hats came to escort the group. I will tend to you as best as i can. So what if it is comfortable? It becomes boring then. Even if I look like this, I was famous as a bard in my times. Who are you trying to speak to without manners at the first encounter? Its just a passing relationship, so just serve them as best you can! \u2018For me to be able to see the Yangtze river like this\u2026 Ju Seo Cheon checked his surroundings as if it was a new feeling. The emotions flashing in his eyes were that of longing. After the treasury gets discovered two years later, the Yangtze river changes into an unapproachable place. It was because of the age of war that would happen not long after. If people passed near the Yangtze river, rather than sightseeing the good view they had to be aware of the enemies that were crossing the river. When the war ended and he became one of the Five Elders of Mount Hua, he had to prove his fidelity so he couldnt even get close to the Yangtze river. The only time he got to appreciate the river properly was at the ceasefire. But even that moment was so short that he didnt remember it clearly. Are there some seats? His thoughts that continued for some while ended at Gu Pungs voice. Of course. The shipowner that was biting a long pipe nodded. He was a white haired old man that had some trained arms. It was proof of having rowed for a long time. Gu Pung gave some coins to the ship owner. I think that the old man will be satisfied by this remuneration. What do you guys think of the scenery? They say that martial artists have a heart as broad as the Yangtze river and it seems like those words were true. Its plentily satisfying to take a seat and just enjoy the view. Jang Hong and Jang Seo Eun followed his back hastily. It was the first time they rode on a boat so it was awkward yet marvelous. Ju Seo Cheon also acted like a kid as if riding on a boat was marvelous and then got on the boat. The ship owner rowed with all his strength and left the estuary. When you dont know what kind of boat to get on, check the arm muscles of this old captain. You can check how much they have rowed this way. The Yangtze river was so big that it took a considerable amount of time to cross it. A long conversation followed naturally after that. Gu Pung mostly taught them about things that would help them in the expedition of Kang Ho. Jang Hong and Jang Seo Eun perked their ears. Ju Seo Cheon also had no experience about skiffs or ship owners so he listened attentively. After about an hour passed they got able to see the other boats crossing the river. But they werent normal ones. Senior Gu Pung, what is that ship? Jang Hong asked curiously. It wasnt a small ship like the skiff but a proper ship. It was like a battleship that seemed like it would operate in the sea. Although it was not exact, it seemed to be about forty feet in length and ten feet in width. Senior brother, look at its sail. Jang Seo Euns hands moved to the hilt of her sword and her eyes were looking at a sail with characters engraved in it. That is called an arc ship and is a kind of battleship. Also, settle down your killing intent and calm down. Gu Pung answered and tapped Jang Seo Euns wrists. But\u2026 Jang Hongs words dimmed as his face got stiff. There was a lingering attachment in his face that he couldnt understand it. You should follow my words calmly. Its an order. Jang Hong and Jang Seo Eun retrieved their killing intent at Gu Pungs strict words. The captain that was rowing by their side, let out a sigh of relief. He rowed to the opposite side and made the boat stop for a moment. And then, the arc ship that was far away came to them. There were several men with rough appearances riding it. They had messy beards, a big physique and scars filling up their faces. And all of them were holding weapons. If there was a common point between them was that they were all wearing blue clothes. Im sorry for having stopped you when you were enjoying your sightseeing on a bright day such as this one. The man with the messiest beard of all came out and saluted by gathering his fist into his palm. His fierce eyes headed to the sleeves of the group. The man checked the plum blossom engraved in their sleeves and spoke with the calmest tone possible. We are martial artists of the Nine Fleets of the Water Forest that protect the Yangtze river. Originally we protected this Yangtze river for compensation\u2026no, for no compensation but recently we are having some financial troubles. If its fine with you will you be able to spare us some money instead of protection? Awkwardness could be felt at the words of the man. It seemed like he was wearing clothes that didnt fit him. Of course we can pay that much when you are protecting the Yangtze river. But I dont have that much money so spare us with this much. Gu Pung placed a silver coin in his thumb and flicked it. The silver coin spun in the air and flew off. The man that spoke first snatched away the silver coin as if he was accustomed to it and saluted again. It was an honor having met the martial artists of the great Mount Hua. Please, pass through. Thank you. Gu Pung signaled the boat captain with his eyes. He greeted the men in blue and advanced by rowing. Jang Hongs and Jang Seo Euns were completely red as if they were enraged not being able to understand. The two of them seemed like they wanted to stand up and say something but Gu Pung stopped them. The boat owner saw that and started to row with more strength. The skiff gained speed and got farther from the arc ship. Senior! When they got so far they couldnt even see the arc ship, Jang Hong couldnt endure his anger and raised his voice. Why are you complying with the pillaging of those pirates! On top of that arent they enemies that belong to the Eighteen Strongholds of the Monsoon Rain! Thats right. They have also said that they belong to the Nine Fleets of the Water Forest. We cant ignore this as martial artists of the Righteous Faction! Even though this place had forces of the Righteous Faction in it, it was also a place where their influence didnt reach. A part of the nine factions and the fifth generations powerful families were taking position nearby but there existed a force that was able to stop them. It was the Eighteen Strongholds of the Monsoon Rain. An alliance between the Nine Camps of the Green Forest and the Nine Fleets of the Water Forest. For reference the Nine Camps of the Green Forest was an association of mountain bandits and the Nine Fleets of the Water Forest an association of pirates. That was a place where the mountain bandits and pirates joined a few dozens of years ago to resist against the persecutions and subjugations of the officers or the martial artists of the Righteous Faction. That strength and scale was quite considerable that not even the officials or the martial artists could touch easily. The words Water Forest were engraved on the sail that Jang Seo Eun discovered. How can a member of the Righteous Faction be scared of a pirate! Even if we havent learned the water arts, they are nothing in front of Mount Huas sword\u2026 Silence! Gu Pung raised his voice for the first time. His eyes and voice contained a lot of strength. The boat owner flinched at that force and stopped rowing. Im sorry elder. Its just that the two of them are too energetic. Dont mind us and keep rowing. Gu Pung spoke to the boat owner and he pressed down his bamboo hat and focused on rowing again. Do you really think im scared of pirates? Gu Pung was a pinnacle expert. Even if they were above water, mere pirates that werent even first rate couldnt become his opponents. He was confident on being able to kill all of them after jumping to the arc ship and sharing a few exchanges with the sword. The reason I gave them money without fighting is that something really troublesome will happen if I didnt. Trouble\u2026? Jang Hong and Jang Seo Eun tilted their heads. First, even if its me I cant assert that I wont miss even one of them. Do you know why? Gu Pung asked Ju Seo Cheon, that was listening calmly. Ju Seo Cheon got flustered at the beginning when the question was redirected at him but then spoke clearly with a calm tone. Pirates are proficient at swimming and they also practice water arts that give them the edge on water. Right. Pirates didnt only have the ability to move freely underwater. They had lots of other favorable powers. They could endure their breath for a long time and their speed moving in the water wasnt to be compared. It would be hard to face them if you were not an expert that could unleash the Water Walking Technique. This was also in the case they didnt dive down. It was close to impossible to catch them if they dived without showing themselves above water and escaped. Gu Pung also excelled in his footwork techniques so he would be able to chase them but it was up to a coin toss if he could catch every single one of them. This translation belongs to Centinni.

In that case, who will bear the consequences? Is it us\u2026no, Mount Hua? Jang Seo Eun wasnt sure of it so she asked carefully. Gu Pung shook his head and turned his head. Its this elder. What? Jang Hong put on a dumbfounded expression like he couldnt understand it. As long as we dont touch the Eighteen Strongholds of the Monsoon Rain, then they wont touch us either. They wont try to get revenge just because I killed a few pirates but they would vent their anger on the boat owner. What wrong did the boat owner commit? Jang Seo Eun asked as if it was absurd. We are not talking about who is in the right and who is in the wrong. Its just venting their anger. The Nine Fleets of the Water Forest, no, the Eighteen Strongholds of the Monsoon Rain dont walk in the black arts for nothing. They are the kind of people to do so. The Eighteen Strongholds of the Monsoon Rain arent guardians or martial artists that care about prestige. They are beings that not even the four factions accept. They are merely a group of bandits. If you are not going to take responsibility for the life of the captain, you better stop. Also, if rumours about that spread no boat owner will let us ride their boat as retaliation of the Eighteen Strongholds of the Monsoon Rain \u2026 Jang Hong and Jang Seo Eun still had their shoulders drooping and werent saying anything as if their shock hadnt faded away. I, no, everyone knows that its wrong but at times there are things you cant do anything about. You will face unreasonable things like this every time you come to Kang Ho. If that time comes, think about what happened today and think before you act. \u2018Ho, I didnt know a pinnacle master could be this rational. Ju Seo Cheon listened to Gu Pungs teachings and was amazed. Experts all had high pride and there was nothing to say about if you were pinnacle experts. Having this way of thinking without having a trace of anger wasnt common at all. The Fourteenth Gallant Sword Gu Pung was used as a sacrificial lamb in the age of war and would die a few years later. It was a regretful thing. If the future changes in this life, and if Gu Pung stays alive. Ju Seo Cheon was wondering about such things. The Eighteen Strongholds of the Monsoon Rain should disappear for these things to not happen. However, as you may already know their scale and strength isnt low at all. It isnt only Mount Hua but the Murim Association will also have to move but that isnt plausible either. Do you know why? Jang Hong and Jang Seo Eun didnt answer. It seemed like the two of them knew something but didnt want to say it. Gu Pung waited silently for an answer to return. Ju Seo Cheon couldnt watch anymore and spoke. Its because the balance will crumble. Elaborate that. Murim still maintained peace before the age of war and that was because the forces maintained a perfect balance of strength. The Murim Association of the Righteous Sect, and the apostles of death of the Death Faction. The Second Generation of The Demonic Paths blood teachings and demonic teachings. The strength of the four power houses were similar and that was why no one could move rashly. Even if they won a battle, the damages they suffered would be great because their forces were similar. So if two forces joined hands in that situation, they would be able to easily get rid of the remaining force. A similar thing would happen if the Murim Association got the Eighteen Strongholds of the Monsoon Rain as their enemies and lost their forces. The remaining three forces could join hands to turn the weakened Murim Association into a wasteland. They really couldnt do anything about it. You know it well. And thats why I also think you know it too. Just that you dont want to say it out loud. Gu Pung looked at Jang Hong and Jang Seo Eun. The two of them agreed with the silence as if his words werent wrong. They couldnt endure the fact that they had to leave the bandits who were right in front of them act as they pleased no matter how unavoidable it was. They were at an age where they were overflowing with justice. It wasnt that they couldnt understand. Its not that you dont understand the idea but the reality in Kang Ho is especially cruel. Think about it well. Gu Pung laughed and that laughter seemed quite bitter. It was the laugh of an adult that had thrown away his dreams and had compromised with reality. The boat arrived at the estuary. The group was able to cross the Yangtze river safely without fighting any pirates. It seemed like Jang Hong and Jang Seo Eun were still in thought. Ju Seo Cheon saw that and laughed inwardly. \u2018I remember the old times. I was also like that. The two of them spoke a lot since they departed but now seemed to be filled with thoughts. Hm, it seems like it didnt affect you at all. Gu Pung looked at Ju Seo Cheon in a strange look. Ju Seo Cheon realized his mistake at those words. He didnt control his expressions as he was looking at Jang Hong and Jang Seo Eun. he had somewhat acted on the boat while thinking of other things but now he had stopped acting. Senior uncle should also know that I have gone out of the sect when I was young. Ahh, it seemed like something happened back then. Yes, I already received the shock back then so its not that big this time. Ju Seo Cheon laughed awkwardly and scratched his head. The group just crossed Chongqing and entered Guizhou. \u2018Im finally at Guizhou. He had just arrived at Guizhou but this place wasnt his destination. The place he had to go was Kaiyang. Starting today you will not be allowed to use any footwork technique. The territories of the Righteous and Death factions inside of Guizhou changed a few times in a day. This land was that chaotic. The Murim Association and the Apostles of Death werent at war but it was different at least here, in Guizhou. There were small and big battles everyday. The expenditure of internal energy was severe when using footwork techniques so it may become dangerous when they encountered enemies. Thats why they stopped using the light step arts and footwork techniques and decided to walk until Kaiyang. \u2018Guizhou! He would have already screamed excitedly if it wasnt for the group. There was someone he had business with, no, he had to find. The treasury of the Three Eyed Immoral God. He had racked his brains everyday to obtain the treasures sleeping in the treasury. He brought up his memories the best he could and established a plan and revised it. The time it took to do that was almost three years. He needed the help of a few people in his plans and it was estimated that one of those people was at Guizhou. \u2018Merchant king, Lee Ui Chae! His name wasnt really known yet but he was someone that would become the best merchant in the midlands one day. Originally he was an ordinary rice dealer but his life changed drastically as the age of war started. Lee Ui Chae was a really greedy person. He would form a connection with a martial artist coincidentally in the age of war. And then obtained small information about the war from that merchant and went to a secluded region and sold the provisions of the army. The other merchants clicked their tongues saying that Lee Ui Chae didnt value his life. Lee Ui Chae gathered up a great deal of money like a rake with this happening and started to increase his wealth and business. Originally, Lee Ui Chaes talents related to money were ghostlike to the point people said that God descended that ability upon him. He had little capital until then and was unlucky but when one opportunity came to him, he used that and grew up at a monstrous rate. \u2018The merchant king is someone I should absolutely never make an enemy of. I have to get that money grubber by my side. Lee Ui Chae didnt belong to the Righteous or Demonic Faction. He was a merchant from beginning to end and his philosophy was scary enough. The Righteous and Demonic Faction. On top of that, the unknown forces that havent shown themselves yet like the Second Generation of The Demonic Path. Lee Ui Chae employed methods to earn money from beginning to end since the age of war started. He didnt belong to any side. The level of his guts wasnt normal . Who would try to make business with Murim as its opponent? He wasnt the merchant king for nothing. \u2018In addition, theres a saying that the winner of the age of war was the merchant king. Lee Ui Chaes worthless Golden Business Group gained countless profits through the age of war. And when everything ended, the Golden Business Group became the best merchant group and descended on the peace that barely arrived. He had so much wealth that people said he could buy the world with his money. \u2018Theres nothing to speak about his talent. If I entrust the treasures to the treasure king, he will mobilize it well by his own. The fact that hes someone I can feel relief and entrust it to him is especially important. There was a possibility of people escaping with the treasures if he entrusted it to them. But Lee Ui Chae wasnt like that. There was a saying between merchants that went \u2018Having no trust is no different from death. Trust between merchants was a must in a business. If that trust was broken, no one would try to make a transaction with them. The reason Lee Ui Chae was able to climb to the seat of merchant king was because of his ability but also because he kept that trust without fail. The most reliable person in the world was Lee Ui Chae if only he was given money. But contrary to that, he was someone unreliable with no money. This meant that there was no one more reliable than the merchant king in a benefiting relationship. But in the opposite case, it was doubtful whether you would even have an opportunity to speak with the merchant king leaving trust aside. Actually, when Lee Ui Chae visited Mount Hua in the past Ju Seo Cheon saw his face several times but he wasnt able to speak to him. It was because Ju Seo Cheon was a shapeless martial artist at that time.

Ju Seo Cheon looked forward to his meeting with the merchant king and walked towards Guizhou with more strength. This translation belongs to Centinni.

In that case, who will bear the consequences? Is it us\u2026no, Mount Hua? Jang Seo Eun wasnt sure of it so she asked carefully. Gu Pung shook his head and turned his head. Its this elder. What? Jang Hong put on a dumbfounded expression like he couldnt understand it. As long as we dont touch the Eighteen Strongholds of the Monsoon Rain, then they wont touch us either. They wont try to get revenge just because I killed a few pirates but they would vent their anger on the boat owner. What wrong did the boat owner commit? Jang Seo Eun asked as if it was absurd. We are not talking about who is in the right and who is in the wrong. Its just venting their anger. The Nine Fleets of the Water Forest, no, the Eighteen Strongholds of the Monsoon Rain dont walk in the black arts for nothing. They are the kind of people to do so. The Eighteen Strongholds of the Monsoon Rain arent guardians or martial artists that care about prestige. They are beings that not even the four factions accept. They are merely a group of bandits. If you are not going to take responsibility for the life of the captain, you better stop. Also, if rumours about that spread no boat owner will let us ride their boat as retaliation of the Eighteen Strongholds of the Monsoon Rain \u2026 Jang Hong and Jang Seo Eun still had their shoulders drooping and werent saying anything as if their shock hadnt faded away. I, no, everyone knows that its wrong but at times there are things you cant do anything about. You will face unreasonable things like this every time you come to Kang Ho. If that time comes, think about what happened today and think before you act. \u2018Ho, I didnt know a pinnacle master could be this rational. Ju Seo Cheon listened to Gu Pungs teachings and was amazed. Experts all had high pride and there was nothing to say about if you were pinnacle experts. Having this way of thinking without having a trace of anger wasnt common at all. The Fourteenth Gallant Sword Gu Pung was used as a sacrificial lamb in the age of war and would die a few years later. It was a regretful thing. If the future changes in this life, and if Gu Pung stays alive. Ju Seo Cheon was wondering about such things. The Eighteen Strongholds of the Monsoon Rain should disappear for these things to not happen. However, as you may already know their scale and strength isnt low at all. It isnt only Mount Hua but the Murim Association will also have to move but that isnt plausible either. Do you know why? Jang Hong and Jang Seo Eun didnt answer. It seemed like the two of them knew something but didnt want to say it. Gu Pung waited silently for an answer to return. Ju Seo Cheon couldnt watch anymore and spoke. Its because the balance will crumble. Elaborate that. Murim still maintained peace before the age of war and that was because the forces maintained a perfect balance of strength. The Murim Association of the Righteous Sect, and the apostles of death of the Death Faction. The Second Generation of The Demonic Paths blood teachings and demonic teachings. The strength of the four power houses were similar and that was why no one could move rashly. Even if they won a battle, the damages they suffered would be great because their forces were similar. So if two forces joined hands in that situation, they would be able to easily get rid of the remaining force. A similar thing would happen if the Murim Association got the Eighteen Strongholds of the Monsoon Rain as their enemies and lost their forces. The remaining three forces could join hands to turn the weakened Murim Association into a wasteland. They really couldnt do anything about it. You know it well. And thats why I also think you know it too. Just that you dont want to say it out loud. Gu Pung looked at Jang Hong and Jang Seo Eun. The two of them agreed with the silence as if his words werent wrong. They couldnt endure the fact that they had to leave the bandits who were right in front of them act as they pleased no matter how unavoidable it was. They were at an age where they were overflowing with justice. It wasnt that they couldnt understand. Its not that you dont understand the idea but the reality in Kang Ho is especially cruel. Think about it well. Gu Pung laughed and that laughter seemed quite bitter. It was the laugh of an adult that had thrown away his dreams and had compromised with reality. The boat arrived at the estuary. The group was able to cross the Yangtze river safely without fighting any pirates. It seemed like Jang Hong and Jang Seo Eun were still in thought. Ju Seo Cheon saw that and laughed inwardly. \u2018I remember the old times. I was also like that. The two of them spoke a lot since they departed but now seemed to be filled with thoughts. Hm, it seems like it didnt affect you at all. Gu Pung looked at Ju Seo Cheon in a strange look. Ju Seo Cheon realized his mistake at those words. He didnt control his expressions as he was looking at Jang Hong and Jang Seo Eun. he had somewhat acted on the boat while thinking of other things but now he had stopped acting. Senior uncle should also know that I have gone out of the sect when I was young. Ahh, it seemed like something happened back then. Yes, I already received the shock back then so its not that big this time. Ju Seo Cheon laughed awkwardly and scratched his head. The group just crossed Chongqing and entered Guizhou. \u2018Im finally at Guizhou. He had just arrived at Guizhou but this place wasnt his destination. The place he had to go was Kaiyang. Starting today you will not be allowed to use any footwork technique. The territories of the Righteous and Death factions inside of Guizhou changed a few times in a day. This land was that chaotic. The Murim Association and the Apostles of Death werent at war but it was different at least here, in Guizhou. There were small and big battles everyday. The expenditure of internal energy was severe when using footwork techniques so it may become dangerous when they encountered enemies. Thats why they stopped using the light step arts and footwork techniques and decided to walk until Kaiyang. \u2018Guizhou! He would have already screamed excitedly if it wasnt for the group. There was someone he had business with, no, he had to find. The treasury of the Three Eyed Immoral God. He had racked his brains everyday to obtain the treasures sleeping in the treasury. He brought up his memories the best he could and established a plan and revised it. The time it took to do that was almost three years. He needed the help of a few people in his plans and it was estimated that one of those people was at Guizhou. \u2018Merchant king, Lee Ui Chae! His name wasnt really known yet but he was someone that would become the best merchant in the midlands one day. Originally he was an ordinary rice dealer but his life changed drastically as the age of war started. Lee Ui Chae was a really greedy person. He would form a connection with a martial artist coincidentally in the age of war. And then obtained small information about the war from that merchant and went to a secluded region and sold the provisions of the army. The other merchants clicked their tongues saying that Lee Ui Chae didnt value his life. Lee Ui Chae gathered up a great deal of money like a rake with this happening and started to increase his wealth and business. Originally, Lee Ui Chaes talents related to money were ghostlike to the point people said that God descended that ability upon him. He had little capital until then and was unlucky but when one opportunity came to him, he used that and grew up at a monstrous rate. \u2018The merchant king is someone I should absolutely never make an enemy of. I have to get that money grubber by my side. Lee Ui Chae didnt belong to the Righteous or Demonic Faction. He was a merchant from beginning to end and his philosophy was scary enough. The Righteous and Demonic Faction. On top of that, the unknown forces that havent shown themselves yet like the Second Generation of The Demonic Path. Lee Ui Chae employed methods to earn money from beginning to end since the age of war started. He didnt belong to any side. The level of his guts wasnt normal . Who would try to make business with Murim as its opponent? He wasnt the merchant king for nothing. \u2018In addition, theres a saying that the winner of the age of war was the merchant king. Lee Ui Chaes worthless Golden Business Group gained countless profits through the age of war. And when everything ended, the Golden Business Group became the best merchant group and descended on the peace that barely arrived. He had so much wealth that people said he could buy the world with his money. \u2018Theres nothing to speak about his talent. If I entrust the treasures to the treasure king, he will mobilize it well by his own. The fact that hes someone I can feel relief and entrust it to him is especially important. There was a possibility of people escaping with the treasures if he entrusted it to them. But Lee Ui Chae wasnt like that. There was a saying between merchants that went \u2018Having no trust is no different from death. Trust between merchants was a must in a business.

Kaiyang was a sizable village. Guizhou was a place that was separated in north and south. The north was the territory of the Righteous Faction and the South was the territory of the Death Faction. Guiyang was a village that was near that place. It was located at the front lines and that was why this place had the most martial artists of the Righteous Faction in it. Oh my, looking at your faces that are fit to be king, you may be great figures of the Righteous Faction. This petty merchant saw these great figures walk in a dignified way from a distance and couldnt keep my excitement. When they entered Guiyang they were able to see several barkers. And among them, the one calling himself a petty merchant approached them first. What is it? Jang Hong looked at the merchant as if it was dumbfounding. Excessive compliment was seen as flattery. The words of the merchant had already passed the level of being a compliment. Haha. Gu Pung looked at the merchant as if it was fun and laughed out loud. He then took out a coin from his bosom and then flicked it towards the merchant. We dont need to unpack the luggage at the inn, so stop with the useless guiding and lead us to the Murims Association here in Guiyang. If you think of pulling anything funny I wont let it pass easily, so keep that in mind. Of course great master! The merchant snatched the coin in the air and bowed down. He had bowed so low that his head was about to touch the ground. And then, the other barkers that were nearby clicked their tongues and fell back. It seemed like they were regretting having missed a customer. Only then did Jang Hong realize what was going on and nodded with his head. If you arrive at another province there will be full of barkers like them. So you just have to give them a few coins and tell them to lead you to where you want. Gu Pung walked slowly and explained kindly. Also, if your destination is a province in the Murim Association there is no need for you to go to an inn. They will get you a lodging except for special occasions. Even though this information was small, it was still enough to be of help in a trip to Kang Ho. If it wasnt something Ju Seo Cheon knew, he would have listened attentively and engraved it into his head. Huk, to say that they will provide lodging in the provinces! The merchant dropped his mouth and got surprised. All the provinces of the Murim Association werent small at all. Every place was capable of easily accommodating a hundred people. But it didnt mean that it was possible for anyone. You would need to have some matters to attend to and also receive permission beforehand. In other words, it meant that third or second rate martial artists or even non affiliated martial artists were chased out of these places. Being able to receive lodging in the provinces meant that they werent third rate. But there was no need to exaggerate like this. It seemed like the reaction of the merchant was flattery itself, the exaggeration behind his actions were too excessive. If its not rude, may I be able to hear your name? The merchant wore a steel plate in his face and cringed. His actions were so bold anyone could realize his intent. I am Gu Pung of Mount Hua. Huk! The Fourteenth Gallant Sword! You didnt seem to be normal even since I saw you from before, but you were a disciple of the great Mount Hua! The merchant opened his eyes widely and raised his voice. \u2018A great figure! The Fourteenth Gallant Sword was a well known expert even in Murim. He did seem to be like an expert because he was escorting these kids but he didnt know he was such a great figure. Connections for a merchant were especially important and there was nothing more to speak about if that connection was one of the great figures. The merchant waved his invisible tail and poured out compliments to Gu Pung. Be quiet. Jang Hong wasnt able to endure it and said a word. His eyes were showing clear scorn. Do you have no pride? Jang Hong looked at the merchant as if it was pathetic. And then, the merchant let out a soft laughter as if he was feeling sorry. It seemed like he wasnt that unaware of his surroundings that he stopped speaking. Jang Hong, whats with that way of speaking. You should be careful with your words if you belong to the Righteous Faction. Its not that I dont understand how you feel but speak softly. Gu Pung rebuked Jang Hong. Im sorry senior uncle. Gu Pung didnt scold Jang Hong anymore as he bowed down. Even if that was the case he was also starting to feel uncomfortable with the merchant. Oh my, it seems like I ruined the atmosphere. I will make up for it later. Here, come over here. We will arrive at the branch office in a while. Jang Seo Eun was about to say something but she stopped. Their relationship would end after they arrived at the branch office anyways. Over here. If you need me to lead you somewhere Ill be near\u2026. This is enough. Thank you/ Gu Pung smiled bitterly and cut off his words. He had taken a roundabout way to tell him not to bother him. Oh my, there has no one been anyone this kind to this barker. Anyways, I will certainly pay you back so just call me! Hehehe! The merchant laughed in a treacherous way and left. They arrived at the branch office and wrote their names in the visitors book. When the one in charge of the register saw the names, they led them kindly to their rooms. Tch, and he told me to keep waiting. One visitor that had been waiting nearby mumbled. Oho, this person. You should be careful of your words. It seems like he is an expert of Mount Hua. Hup, Mount Hua Sect? Oh my, I almost made a big mistake. Thank you. The visitor lowered his head and hid his face in case someone recognized him. I doubt he knew we heard him as we seem like ordinary children, right? Jang Seo Eun mumbled with a strange expression. What does senior brother think? About what? Ju Seo Cheon replied as she called out to him. The treatment of the one in charge of the register. Ju Seo Cheon shut his mouth at her words for a moment and then answered honestly. Life is not equal in the first place. Treatment changes just with your birth. No, it may also change depending on your abilities. Isnt that reality. Ju Seo Cheon had received unfair treatment in his past life. No, it was the same even after he returned in time. In his past life he received great treatment because of his background as someone part of the Mount Hua Sect but at times he did receive discrimination because he was a really plain martial artist. Right now, he was being discriminated against and being laughed at with his nickname. You can see discrimination everywhere. You can already see that with the Lotus Peak in Mount Hua and\u2026 Ju Seo Cheon was about to continue speaking but stopped. It was because of his surroundings. He had spoken out loud too much. Those words didnt belong to a twelve year old kid at all. Ju Seo Cheon rolled his eyes and sweated. Haha, you are called the flashy but frail one and yet your head is certainly flashy. It seems like you have heard those words from somewhere! Jang Hong didnt think about Ju Seo Cheons words too deeply. For him, Ju Seo Cheon was the flashy and frail one. He was an incompetent being that managed to enter the Lotus Peak with a certain coincidence and luck. Jang Seo Eun just looked at him in a marvelous way, it seemed like she wasnt thinking too deeply about it. Hm. But it was different for Gu Pung. He was looking at Ju Seo Cheon as if it was really interesting and fell in thought. \u2018He also proved it in Yangtze River. The wisdom of this kid Ju Seo Cheon is more outstanding than other kids. If his quality was also good he could have aimed to become a Plum Blossom Sword Examiner, its a real regret. But that was only increasing the evaluation on him. He didnt see Ju Seo Cheon as being particularly great. Whew, lets be careful. Ju Seo Cheon let out a sigh of relief. Maybe it was because of the unfair treatment he received in his past life of not being able to speak what he wanted to but now, his thoughts came out in words right away. Of course, he was planning to live that way from now on but there were still times that he had to hold back. I am called Shin Do Gyun, the branch manager of Guiyang. Its an honor being able to meet the Fourteenth Gallant Sword. Shin Do Gyun showed his white teeth and greeted him. It is an honor for me for being able to meet the branch manager that is at the front lines of Guizhou. Gu Pung replied at Shin Do Gyuns greet with a smiling face. Shin Do Gyun smiled as someone at the level of the Fourteenth Gallant Sword paid him a compliment. I have already prepared a room and dinner for you so you will be escorted to it when you get out of this room. Im thankful towards you, branch manager of Guiyang, for your great consideration. I just did what I had to. Moreover, are those young ones members of the Lotus Peak? Is that correct? The three people nodded. The Lotus Peak of Mount Hua was known in Murim as much as the War Dragons Hall of the Shamans Faction and boasted of its long history. Because of that, it became the talk of the down when disciples came out to Kang Ho with a guardian before they became adults. Kids that werent even twenty years old and belonged to the Mount Hua sect. On top of that they had a pinnacle expert guarding them so the answer was obvious. For me to be able to see the future experts that will shoulder the fate of Mount Hua one day, it isnt so bad to be a branch manager of a province at all. Moreover, this wasnt the first time members of the Lotus Peak visited Guiyang. Countless members had already visited this place. Guizhou being in the front lines meant that even though there were many enemies, there were also many experts of the Murim Association in it. That also meant that they would be able to accumulate experience while being protected by an expert. Besides the Lotus Peak, a place where geniuses gathered, low leveled institutions also visited this place with the purpose of accumulating experience and merits. In the case of the guardian of the Lotus Peak, they changed every year so it was the first time the branch manager met with Gu Pung. The visit of the martial artists from the Lotus Peak was something Shim Do Gyun received annually. No matter what mission you request us to do, we will fulfill it in the name of Mount Hua. And the tasks to get real experience were tasked down to the branch manager. He was one of the people that knew the situation around this place better than anyone. Hahaha, your chivalrous spirit is different indeed. As expected of the Fourteenth Gallant Sword. I will give you your mission soon. Shin Do Gyun smiled softly. Ah, in addition the Zhuge Sega is here in the province of Guiyang. You will probably be tasked with him in the same mission so it wont be bad to work on your teamwork beforehand. Gu Pung nodded as if he had expected it. Guizhou was a place to accumulate experience or merits. There were many other martial artists of the Righteous Faction besides Mount Hua sect. Most of them visit this place once in a year but it was an exception for some forces. And one of them was Zhuge Sega. Zhuge Sega was located at Hubei but they sent their families to this place with the purpose of grasping the situation to set up a strategy and accumulate patrolling experience. It didnt matter much as Zhuge Sega didnt fight much in the front lines. \u2018Zhuge Sega! Ju Seo Cheon got greatly excited at those words. \u2018I dont know if its the right time but\u2026","title":"volcanic-20"},{"location":"volcanic-20/#vocanic-age-chapter-20","text":"Editor: Imagine After a few days the group was able to arrive at Kaiyang.

And the tasks to get real experience were tasked down to the branch manager. He was one of the people that knew the situation around this place better than anyone. Hahaha, your chivalrous spirit is different indeed. As expected of the Fourteenth Gallant Sword. I will give you your mission soon. Shin Do Gyun smiled softly. Ah, in addition the Zhuge Sega is here in the province of Guiyang. You will probably be tasked with him in the same mission so it wont be bad to work on your teamwork beforehand. Gu Pung nodded as if he had expected it. Guizhou was a place to accumulate experience or merits. There were many other martial artists of the Righteous Faction besides Mount Hua sect. Most of them visit this place once in a year but it was an exception for some forces. And one of them was Zhuge Sega. Zhuge Sega was located at Hubei but they sent their families to this place with the purpose of grasping the situation to set up a strategy and accumulate patrolling experience. It didnt matter much as Zhuge Sega didnt fight much in the front lines. \u2018Zhuge Sega! Ju Seo Cheon got greatly excited at those words. \u2018I dont know if its the right time but\u2026","title":"Vocanic Age Chapter 20"},{"location":"volcanic-21/","text":"Vocanic Age Chapter 21 Hello guys, We are looking for peeps who are have basic social media apps usage knowledge.

This is volunteer work~ In return, u will get to read free future chaps for the novel of your liking from our website!! ========================= Editor: Imagine Gu Pung went to the place where Zhuge Sega was gathered at as it wasnt that hard to find them. The territory of Guizhou wasnt that wide and it was hard to approach them if they werent a force of the same rank. In the case of other visitors, and especially martial artists, they couldnt get closer because of the wall they had set up and could only watch from far away. The Fourteenth Gallant Sword! A middle aged man that had the beard like a goats and was dressed like a scholar raised his hand from far away and greeted Gu Pung. Oh, isnt it the Goatie Minister Zhuge Zak? Its been a really long while. Gu Pung and Zhuge Zak knew each other. It has been three years. Zhuge Zak glanced behind Gu Pung. By the way, it looks like the young ones behind you belong to the Lotus Peak. Is their protector perhaps the Fourteenth Gallant Sword? You saw it correctly. Haha, what a coincidence. Im also in the same situation as you. Zhuge Sak glanced at the people that were on hold behind him. The age and the gender of the group was varied but they had a similarity of having a thin body. Zhuge Sega has also brought the children that will become the next brilliant generation of the Righteous Faction. I think that this is also fate so if its fine with you I would like to create a place of harmony to interact with each other. They are all my nieces and nephews. Nice to meet you great master. Its an honor being able to meet the Fourteenth Gallant Sword I have only heard through rumors. Zhuge Zak had three nieces. The youth that stood at the front was eye catching and he had white skin, a sharp jaw and outstanding beauty. If it wasnt for his voice, that had changed through puberty, or his clothes one would mistake him for a woman because of his beauty. Behind him were a boy and a girl that werent adults yet, just like Ju Seo Cheon. The boy had his shoulders drooping and his face couldnt be easily seen due to that he emanated a gloomy atmosphere. In the case of the girl, she was bright and proud compared to the boy. Her beauty was also considerable, although it wasnt comparable to Nak Seo Wol. Oh, are you perhaps\u2026 Gu Pungs eyes turned wide and looked at the youth. It seemed like he realized who this youth was. I am called Zhuge Sang. In Kang Ho I am called by the embarrassing nickname of Beautiful Jade Confucian. The youth blushed and smiled bitterly. I was wondering why you were so familiar! So you were a young master of the Zhuge family! Gu Pung placed a fist on his palm and mumbled as if he was correct. The Beautiful Jade Confucian, Zhuge Sang. His beauty was known to the world early on even though he was a boy. But besides that, he also had a reputation for being the one that would lead the Zhuge family. I am Zhuge Suran. Brother Sang is my step brother. The introduction of Zhuge Suran was a bit insensitive so Gu Pung flinched at that moment but then passed it as if it was nothing. These kinds of things were common in a great family like the Zhuge Clan. Ah, Zhuge Suran! Jang Hong got surprised at the name Zhuge Suran and let out an exclamation. Everyone nearby turned to look at him. Oh my, im sorry. Jang Hong scratched his head and apologized as he thought that the introduction got cut off because of him. Theres no need to feel sorry. On the contrary, Im happy that a member of the Lotus Peak knows Suran. Zhuge Sak smiled proudly. How would I not know about her? Of course I know her. Jang Hong glanced at Zhuge Suran and flushed. The existence of Zhuge Suran itself was enough to lit up a fire on the heart of a boy that only trained all his life. In addition, all males tend to be attracted to the opposite sex, whether they are kids, adults or the elderly. This was an unchangeable law. Zhuge Suran was the daughter of another woman but she was still a daughter of the family, so it was unavoidable that her fame would spread. Most of all, she looked dignified since she was young but also became popular because of the intellect she possessed. As expected of someone from the Zhuge Sega. Because of these reasons, no one could see her lightly even though she was the daughter of another woman. Thats an excessive compliment but im still grateful that you speak that way about me. Zhuge Suran didnt smile but still replied back with softer eyes than before. Jang Hongs face turned even redder, like a ripe persimmon. And\u2026 I, Im called\u2026. Zhuge\u2026Seung-Kye\u2026 A little boy the same age as Zhuge Suran. Zhuge Seung Kye introduced himself with a crawling voice. A voice with no strength, drooping shoulders and no confidence. That was the opposite of Zhuge Suran. Um, Im lacking knowledge so I dont know much about this young noble. Im sorry. Gu Pung tilted his head slightly. Its obvious as Seung Kye doesnt show himself even in the Zhuge Sega. Hes a lacking child so I hope you understand. He is a good child. Zhuge Sang stood next to Zhuge Seung Kye and patted his shoulder. It was a really nice smile. Haha, it seems like he will get along well with you, brother. Jang Hong hit Ju Seo Cheons shoulders and mumbled. He was claiming boldly that he was looking down on Zhuge Seung Kye. If its fine with you, could you introduce me to the young nobles that will bear the future of Mount Hua? Zhuge Sak looked at the three members of the Lotus Peak with interest and asked. Gu Pung answered that he could obviously do that and introduced Jang Hong first. On the other hand, Ju Seo Cheon, whose introduction got put last, was looking at one place fixedly. \u2018Hahaha! He wanted to laugh out loud right now. His excitement didnt settle down like before. It had been like this ever since the name of the Zhuge Sega came out. A strange sense passed by his spine. His eyes were still looking at that one person. \u2018Honestly speaking, I wasnt even expecting you to be here. I just had my hopes. He didnt know what happened in this generation but there were a big number of people that would be remembered as heroes. Zhuge Sang, the one who would be called the Thousand Man Army in the future was one of the figures that represented those figures. Zhuge Sang showed extraordinary abilities even before he turned thirty, while Murim was filled with war, and got recognized. Zhuge Sangs skills and quality was recognized even before he inherited the Zhuge Sega family and became a commander of the Murim Association. But he became a target of the enemy forces precisely because of his extraordinary abilities and got assassinated five years after he became a commander. \u2018I was planning to somehow convince the merchant king after I met him to find you. After that the position of commander of the Murim Association was inherited by his step sister, the beautiful schemer Zhuge Suran. While Zhuge Sang was active, Zhuge Suran had assisted him by his side and her abilities werent normal either. If Zhuge Sang was proficient at military tactics and strategies, Zhuge Suran was proficient at unseen schemes. People saw these two and praised them for being connected deeper than anyone else, even though they were born from different bellies. The countless strategies, tactics and schemes that came out from the Murim Association at the age of war came mostly from these two. The world saw them and said that Zhuge Liang [1] was reborn after being separated as a man and woman. Fortunately, the Beautiful Schemer managed to survive by being aware of the surroundings of the Thousand Man Army but she died when the age of war ended. The cause of her death was ironically the same as the Thousand Man Army, assassination. She was that aware and careful but in the end she wasnt able to avoid it. And one more person\u2026 \u2018The Late Partner of Heaven, Zhuge Seung Kye! He was the figure Ju Seo Cheon was looking for as the number one priority just like the merchant king. He was a bit surprised when he heard the names of the Thousand Man Army and the Beautiful Schemer but he didnt think it was weird. The two people were rumored to have a strong bond between brother and sister. He also knew long ago that the two of them had been together since they were young. Also, the direct bloodline of the Zhuge Sega visited the nearbys of Kaiyang to check the situation so it was also understandable that they were here. But that wasnt the case for Zhuge Seung Kye. He wasnt able to hide his surprise as soon as he saw him. The Late Partner of Heaven, Zhuge Seung Kye, was not originally someone that would come to this kind of place. Originally, he was planning to entrust the merchant king or use another method to find him. He did have his hopes when he heard that the Zhuge Sega were at Kaiyang, but he didnt raise his hopes too high. Ju Seo Cheon also thought that there was no way for Zhuge Seung Kye to come to this place. That is\u2026because he was so incompetent that it was doubtful whether he would even be able to get out Hubei. Tch tch, no matter how incompetent you are, you make people stifled and annoyed. Fix that attitude of yours. When the introduction of the members of the Lotus Peak ended, Zhuge Sak clicked his tongue and looked at Zhuge Seung Kye as if he was pathetic. Look at the young nobles of the Lotus Peak. They are this outstanding even though they are the same age as you. I wouldnt rebuke you like this if you were even half as competent as them. Zhuge Seung Kye didnt say anything and just lowered his head. He had lowered it so low that they couldnt even see his face. What the Sega requested from you isnt anything great. Just practice the basic energy circulation like everyone else, stop practicing something useless like the Art of Machinery and study the Fortune Telling Battle Tactics! Gu Pung didnt know what to do. He had a really troubled expression. Zhuge Sak didnt mind his surroundings at all and reprimanded Zhuge Seung Kye in his face. Zhuge Seung Kye still held his head low and stood still without saying anything. He didnt even move. Uh ahem. It seemed like Zhuge Zaks excitement calmed down after having gotten angry for a long time and cleared his throat. After that, he looked towards the side of Mount Huas group and apologized with a sorry face while scratching his head. Im sorry for having shown such disgraceful behavior in front of the young nobles and the Fourteenth Gallant Sword. I just hoped that this kid would look at the members of the Lotus Peak of Mount Hua and reflect on it. Its fine. Gu Pung scratched his head and smiled bitterly. The time we will be doing the mission together will be short but I hope you dont mind me and scold him as much as you want. Its a serious matter as he still hasnt gotten a hold of himself. He is completely useless right now but I hope he changes through this mission. Zhuge Zak started to curse again. It was to the point that he made the people watching him exhausted. This is all because of your actions! You brought this upon yourself. Thats why you are called the Poor and Weird Scholar! He was weird for getting involved with things that didnt matter. It was the nickname he had obtained before going out to Kang Ho. He wasnt known in all of Kang Ho but at least that nickname was quite well known in Hubei, where Zhuge Sega was located. It was an obvious thing but that nickname didnt mean anything good. This was also the reason why Ju Seo Cheon hadnt been expecting Zhuge Seung Kye to come here. The current treatment of Zhuge Seung Kye was the worst in Murim and even inside the Zhuge Sega. \u2018Right, its unavoidable being treated like that. The Arts of Machinery was a discarded technique. It was to the point that Zhuge Sega turned their back on it. The reason for that was that even the Second Generation of The Demonic Path neglected the Arts of Machinery. If the enemy forces used it, they would have gained interest in it at least to take a grasp on the technique but that wasnt the case either. In the end, both sides only left a small record about it and in the current age it was almost completely forgotten. Studying in the Arts of Machinery was reason enough to get scolded at but on top of that Zhuge Seung Kye didnt even learn the martial arts of the Zhuge Sega family properly. No, precisely speaking, he had tried to learn it but had no talent towards it. The bloodline of the Zhuge Sega certainly had no talent towards studying the martial arts, compared to other martial artists. In the first place, the Zhuge Sega was a family that had people with a more outstanding brain rather than body. Honestly speaking, it didnt matter much if they werent good at martial arts. What the Zhuge Sega was proud of was their head, the Fortune Telling Battle Tactics, etc. But Zhuge Seung Kye had no talent at all. He wasnt even at the level of a normal martial artist. It was hard to even find someone with the worst talent like him, and as he didnt even study the Fortune Telling Battle Tactics it would be weirder if he didnt get cursed at.

Jang Hong and Jang Seo Eun seemed to be really excited. The two of them wandered around like fish on water because it was their first time outside of Mount Hua. The time limit was four days and that was because their mission would start four days later. Zhuge Sang and Zhuge Suran stayed together. Zhuge Sang spoke actively with Jang Hong and Jang Seo Eun to accumulate friendship with the members of Mount Hua as the future leader of the Zhuge. Jang Hong showed interest in Zhuge Suran and mostly stayed around her. Moreover little brother Jang, is that fellow disciple of yours also a bit special inside of Mount Hua? Zhuge Sang had a more extraordinary head than others and also had a good personality. Jang Hong and Jang Seo Eun followed Zhuge Sang immediately and they got so close in a day that they started to speak comfortably to each other. Jang Hong nodded at Zhuge Sangs question. Yes, brother Sang. That guy is called the \u2018flashy yet frail one\u2026 Jang Hong started to explain about Ju Seo Cheon. It seems like the weird people are attracted to each other. Jang Seo Eun shrugged her shoulder and couldnt help smirking. Zhuge Sang had gotten quite close to Jang Hong and Jang Seo Eun but he wasnt even able to have a conversation with Ju Seo Cheon. I didnt know that there would be anyone that would show interest in Seung Kye, and I would have never imagined that that person was a martial artist of the Lotus Peak. Zhuge Sang couldnt hide his astonishment. Ju Seo Cheon approached Zhuge Seung Kye and spoke to him. Hello Seung Kye. Do you want to be friends with this mister? Hey, arent you only two years older than me? What do you mean with mister? Stop spouting nonsense and go away! Zhuge Seung Kye looked at Ju Seo Cheon in an absurd way. Wow, if your uncle had seen you act this way he would have been really surprised. Would he have ever imagined that Seung Kye was such a great man? Huh? Isnt that right? As soon as he was allowed to move freely he went to find Zhuge Seung Kye, who was stuck in his room, and spoke to him persistently. Even Zhuge Seung Kye treated Ju Seo Cheon as a rare specimen. Just why are you being like this? Zhuge Seung Kye himself knew that he was weird. Everyone looked at him that way so he would be a fool not to notice that. This mister just wants to talk to you. Ju Seo Cheon smiled softly. \u2018Right, lets compliment him first. It will be dangerous if I dont handle him properly. He would love to grab him from his collar and threaten him by saying \u2018kid, lets go raid a treasury!. Its weird for me to say this but it would be good for you to not get along with me. I have only learned up to the second star of the Small Heavenly Star Arts and Im a pathetic bastard that is stubborn on learning something useless at this age like the Arts of Machinery! Zhuge Seung Kye put on a teary face and raised his voice. It seemed like he had a lot of pent up emotions. Ju Seo Cheon put on an understanding expression at this. Right. Even I know that your nature isnt that good and that you are a retard that starts to sob at anything. I didnt go that far\u2026 But its not bad being interested in the Arts of Machinery. Its the opposite, I think that its really amazing studying something that no one puts their hands on constantly without bending your will. Ju Seo Cheon patted Zhuge Seung Kyes shoulders and made a soft smile. His eyes were showing desperation. Thats why you shouldnt stop and continue walking on your own path. The Late Known: Partner of Heaven. His evaluation spread late, just like his nickname indicated. Zhuge Seung Kye received attention from the first time at the Treasury of the Three Eyed Immoral God. It was because of the traps installed there. The Righteous Faction and especially the Zhuge Sega family obtained a great amount of treasures thanks to Zhuge Seung Kyes knowledge in traps and machinery. Zhuge Seung Kye thought that he would get reevaluated as having been disregarded until now but that was a big mistake. He did attract attention once again but the gazes of the people were mostly saying \u2018so you do have your uses. Murim was a world based purely on strength. Most people got recognized and evaluated by their martial arts. Zhuge Sega was a bit of an exception but it didnt mean that they didnt look at martial arts at all. It couldnt be helped being ignored if he had worse martial prowess than the children of Zhuge Sega. It would have been different if he had studied the Fortune Telling Battle Tactics that required you to use your head but he wasnt even able to do that so had heard ridiculing laughs inside of his family and even outside. The comparison became worse every time because of the existence of the two geniuses, Zhuge Cheon and Zhuge Suran. And in the end Zhuge Seng Kye couldnt endure the ill treatment he received from the elders such as Zhuge Sak and died. But the cause of death was suicide. Listen well little brother. Even if the entire world ignores you, at least I wont. Remember that I am with you. Your self esteem would fall naturally if you receive scorn and disdain since you were young. And that point influenced his personality greatly. Even though I havent met you for long, I felt fate. If there was alcohol at least I would have shared a drink with you and become sworn brothers. Its really unfortunate. Im not planning to become your little brother\u2026. Call me big brother comfortably Seung Kye. Low self esteem and a shy personality didnt bring good results. The result for that was that Zhuge Seung Kye would live a life where he would only get used without having any leisure. Dont bend your will like you have done until now. Theres no need to deny everything you have accumulated and studied until now. If the world doesnt recognize you, then I will. I will yell towards the one that ignored my little brother to not spout nonsense. When Zhuge Seung Kyes existence was about to get completely forgotten, his existence emerged once again. And that was thanks to his skills in the Arts of Machinery. The Arts of Machinery that was thought to have disappeared completely got reborn completely at the age of war thanks to another force. The only person that could answer to the Arts of Machinery was Zhuge Seung Kye as it was a technique that wasnt used well. After this, Zhuge Segas influence obviously soared to the skies. It was an obvious thing as Zhuge Seung Kye was the only person that could be called an expert in the Arts of Machinery. But Zhuge Seung Kye couldnt call that as being good. The evaluation on him certainly increased after this case and everything he had done until now wasnt in vain. That was a happy thing. But entrusting this to only Zhuge Seung Kye was a really burdensome thing. Having only one proficient person in the Arts of Machinery meant that he had to take care of everything related to it alone. He had to work alone in a room under surveillance disguised as an escort without any help at all. It was normal to go insane under that pressure. He would have loved to reject them all but he couldnt do that due to his timid personality that originated from the continued pressure since he was young. If he raised his voice even a little bit they yelled at him saying that he was an adult of the Zhuge Sega and that he had to think of the Sega. Everytime they did that he wasnt able to decline them and in the end he got trapped in a bird cage called the Sega family and wasnt able to see the outside properly either. Zhuge Seung Kye got used until he died and that pressure influenced the cause of his death directly and made him catch an illness. After about forty something years, when Zhuge Seung Kye was in his mid fifties, he ends up committing suicide after being used thoroughly. That was a really miserable life. \u2018Whats worse is that even then he wasnt as respected as he should have been. The evaluation on Zhuge Seung Kye was still too vague at that time. It was hard to get recognized in Murim if you didnt have strength or martial arts. You could already see that in Zhuge Sega and the Sichuan Family as they were a bit ignored between martial artists. In case of forgotten arts like the Arts of Machinery it was more serious. No matter how impressive Zhuge Sega was, everyone tended to ignore him in their treatment. This also influenced the death of Zhuge Sega. His death was terribly bitter as he died without having anyone he could call as family and even his funeral was miserable. After that, time passed by and the Righteous Faction of Murim regretted this happening. In the beginning when Zhuge Seung Kye died, they were worried about who would be the responsible one for the Arts of Machinery. At this, Zhuge Sega boasted and told them not to worry. Although Zhuge Seung Kye didnt raise any scholars, they thought they could solve it as there were the books and documents he had left behind. But they would realize not long after that that thought was really foolish. Zhuge Seung Kye was a peerless genius. His knowledge and comprehension wasnt something that could be followed by the people of Zhuge Sega. He had recorded his own thoughts in the books but that was still the thoughts of a genius. That was so hard to understand that no one could interpret it or even understand it. In the first place Zhuge Seung Kye had never thought of anyone or had any interaction with other people. There was no way someone like that would prepare records for someone else to read and in the end no one was able to obtain his knowledge. After that, the Murim Association and the Righteous Faction included werent able to react to the Machinery of the enemy. They ended up suffering great damages without being able to do anything. Only then did Zhuge Sega regret it greatly and after this matter got known after the age of war ended, they received great scorn and disdain. That was the Late Known Partner of Heaven. Hey, speak honestly. My uncle entrusted you to do something about me, right? Of course that is the case. Scram! It seemed like there was a long way to go. The wait had ended and the mission came to them. If you go south from Kaiyang for two days you will arrive at Weng An. It is a place where the flags of the Murim Association and the River of Death change every two or three months. When we checked yesterday, our side was being pushed behind so I hope you can go and assist the warriors of the Murim Association. Shin Do Gyun finished speaking and glanced at Gu Pung and Zhuge Sak. Hm. Gu Pung let out a sound. He had a face like he was drowning in thought. It will be a bit dangerous but it will be a good experience for Sang and Suran. It is obviously fine. Zhuge Sang welcomed it. Weng An was the most intense territory of all of Guizhous war zone and there that many injured and dead people came out from that place. It was a place where a lot of disciples of the great sects with no experience get arrogant and die. Many experts of the Death Faction also appear in this place as its the front lines. They werent at the level of a hundred generation expert but even so, enemies you should be aware of still appeared. \u2018How rude. Shin Do Gyuns brows twitched faintly at Zhuge Saks words. There was an unpleasant feeling showing in his eyes. The Zhuge Sega dont fight with the martial artists of the Death Faction anyways. They only set up strategies and gave orders from behind. He didnt think badly of it because the specialty of Zhuge Sega was using their head but those words werent of courtesy as it could be heard as \u2018it doesnt involve us anyways. He had said that going to a dangerous place would be of experience to them so what would Gu Pung think about that? \u2026I understand. Mount Hua sect accepts. Gu Pung received the mission after a while. Those are good news! Shin Do Gyun rejoiced at those words. The Fourteenth Gallant Sword was a pinnacle expert everybody knew. The morale of the warriors was secured with this. Even if an expert of the Death Faction appeared, they could feel relieved because they had Gu Pung. \u2018I should prepare it so that the Fourteenth Gallant Sword doesnt have to mind about the members of the Lotus Peak and is able to fight freely. He was anxious about Gu Pung rejecting the mission. Originally, he had planned to give them a safer mission but the notices he received from Weng An were so urgent he couldnt do anything about it. But fortunately Gu Pung had accepted so he could feel a bit relieved about the matter in Weng An. And about one oclock on that same day. They received the details about their mission and left Kaiyang. Weng An, Weng An\u2026. What do I have to be careful about at this time? He closed his eyes and searched in his memories. But that happened too long ago and Weng An is a place where its owner changes dozens of times in a year. There were so many things happening in it that there was nothing that stood out in that place. Mister, why do you keep following me. Zhuge Seung Kye mumbled with dead eyes. Ju Seo Cheon stuck next to Zhuge Seung Kye wherever he went and the warriors of the Murim Association that got to accompany them mumbled to each other. They are still young but they shouldnt have that kind of relationship, right? Sh, save your words. He may become the Plum Blossom Sword Examiner in the future. What if he remembers our faces and comes to find us later? Dont you know that the kids of the nine sects all have a dirty temperament? Each one of them are famous for being dislikeable. Honestly speaking, you should be the one we are worried about. Ahem! And you dont have to worry about that brat called Ju Seo Cheon. A while ago brother Jang told me that he was called the flashy yet frail one. He only became a member of the Lotus Peak because he was lucky, it seems like theres nothing great about him in reality. Ho, its already really lucky having entered Mount Hua sect but he entered the Lotus Peak on top of that? Im really starting to dislike that kid. This translation belongs to Centinni.

Jang Hong and Jang Seo Eun seemed to be really excited. The two of them wandered around like fish on water because it was their first time outside of Mount Hua. The time limit was four days and that was because their mission would start four days later. Zhuge Sang and Zhuge Suran stayed together. Zhuge Sang spoke actively with Jang Hong and Jang Seo Eun to accumulate friendship with the members of Mount Hua as the future leader of the Zhuge. Jang Hong showed interest in Zhuge Suran and mostly stayed around her. Moreover little brother Jang, is that fellow disciple of yours also a bit special inside of Mount Hua? Zhuge Sang had a more extraordinary head than others and also had a good personality. Jang Hong and Jang Seo Eun followed Zhuge Sang immediately and they got so close in a day that they started to speak comfortably to each other. Jang Hong nodded at Zhuge Sangs question. Yes, brother Sang. That guy is called the \u2018flashy yet frail one\u2026 Jang Hong started to explain about Ju Seo Cheon. It seems like the weird people are attracted to each other. Jang Seo Eun shrugged her shoulder and couldnt help smirking. Zhuge Sang had gotten quite close to Jang Hong and Jang Seo Eun but he wasnt even able to have a conversation with Ju Seo Cheon. I didnt know that there would be anyone that would show interest in Seung Kye, and I would have never imagined that that person was a martial artist of the Lotus Peak. Zhuge Sang couldnt hide his astonishment. Ju Seo Cheon approached Zhuge Seung Kye and spoke to him. Hello Seung Kye. Do you want to be friends with this mister? Hey, arent you only two years older than me? What do you mean with mister? Stop spouting nonsense and go away! Zhuge Seung Kye looked at Ju Seo Cheon in an absurd way. Wow, if your uncle had seen you act this way he would have been really surprised. Would he have ever imagined that Seung Kye was such a great man? Huh? Isnt that right? As soon as he was allowed to move freely he went to find Zhuge Seung Kye, who was stuck in his room, and spoke to him persistently. Even Zhuge Seung Kye treated Ju Seo Cheon as a rare specimen. Just why are you being like this? Zhuge Seung Kye himself knew that he was weird. Everyone looked at him that way so he would be a fool not to notice that. This mister just wants to talk to you. Ju Seo Cheon smiled softly. \u2018Right, lets compliment him first. It will be dangerous if I dont handle him properly. He would love to grab him from his collar and threaten him by saying \u2018kid, lets go raid a treasury!. Its weird for me to say this but it would be good for you to not get along with me. I have only learned up to the second star of the Small Heavenly Star Arts and Im a pathetic bastard that is stubborn on learning something useless at this age like the Arts of Machinery! Zhuge Seung Kye put on a teary face and raised his voice. It seemed like he had a lot of pent up emotions. Ju Seo Cheon put on an understanding expression at this. Right. Even I know that your nature isnt that good and that you are a retard that starts to sob at anything. I didnt go that far\u2026 But its not bad being interested in the Arts of Machinery. Its the opposite, I think that its really amazing studying something that no one puts their hands on constantly without bending your will. Ju Seo Cheon patted Zhuge Seung Kyes shoulders and made a soft smile. His eyes were showing desperation. Thats why you shouldnt stop and continue walking on your own path. The Late Known: Partner of Heaven. His evaluation spread late, just like his nickname indicated. Zhuge Seung Kye received attention from the first time at the Treasury of the Three Eyed Immoral God. It was because of the traps installed there. The Righteous Faction and especially the Zhuge Sega family obtained a great amount of treasures thanks to Zhuge Seung Kyes knowledge in traps and machinery. Zhuge Seung Kye thought that he would get reevaluated as having been disregarded until now but that was a big mistake. He did attract attention once again but the gazes of the people were mostly saying \u2018so you do have your uses. Murim was a world based purely on strength. Most people got recognized and evaluated by their martial arts. Zhuge Sega was a bit of an exception but it didnt mean that they didnt look at martial arts at all. It couldnt be helped being ignored if he had worse martial prowess than the children of Zhuge Sega. It would have been different if he had studied the Fortune Telling Battle Tactics that required you to use your head but he wasnt even able to do that so had heard ridiculing laughs inside of his family and even outside. The comparison became worse every time because of the existence of the two geniuses, Zhuge Cheon and Zhuge Suran. And in the end Zhuge Seng Kye couldnt endure the ill treatment he received from the elders such as Zhuge Sak and died. But the cause of death was suicide. Listen well little brother. Even if the entire world ignores you, at least I wont. Remember that I am with you. Your self esteem would fall naturally if you receive scorn and disdain since you were young. And that point influenced his personality greatly. Even though I havent met you for long, I felt fate. If there was alcohol at least I would have shared a drink with you and become sworn brothers. Its really unfortunate. Im not planning to become your little brother\u2026. Call me big brother comfortably Seung Kye. Low self esteem and a shy personality didnt bring good results. The result for that was that Zhuge Seung Kye would live a life where he would only get used without having any leisure. Dont bend your will like you have done until now.

I will yell towards the one that ignored my little brother to not spout nonsense. When Zhuge Seung Kyes existence was about to get completely forgotten, his existence emerged once again.

Its not even a battle between the Righteous and Death faction so why is Guizhou the only place that isnt peaceful and is always at war? Zhuge Seung Kye mumbled with a doubtful voice. It wasnt that a battle occurred for a short while, it continued for tens of years. Murim was maintaining peace because of the balance of power and war didnt occur because of that so it was weird why only Guizhou was like this. Guizhou is a balance that differentiates the territory of the Righteous and Death faction. Even if they had agreed to a ceasefire agreement, it was obvious as to what would happen if you left martial artists together while fretting for not having been able to kill each other in the front lines. Ju Seo Cheon cleared up Zhuge Seung Kyes doubts. \u2018I heard that he was only interested in the Arts of Machinery. To think that the rumor was true. He doesnt know anything about the situation in Murim. I will have to engrave it in his head even if I have to use force later. It will be troublesome if he doesnt even have the basic knowledge. He would have loved to scold him and tell him to at least memorize that much but he had to get close with him now. There is no need to stimulate a kid that is filled with enmity and caution. No matter how you try to control them, martial artists have favor and spite. That monster-like emotion paralyzes even your rationality and this is the result of that. Ju Seo Cheon put on a smile that didnt suit his age. Guizhou is a place that is especially like that. It Favored spite endlessly until it became uncontrollable. It means that no one is able to cut this cycle you genius. Ahemm, genius? Your intentions are too obvious but it doesnt feel bad. Zhuge Seung Kyes lips curled up until it reached his ear globes. \u2018Huhu, simple brat. Ju Seo Cheon smiled inwardly. Kids were beings that were easy to handle. \u2026Wait. A shadow was cast on the face of the smiling Zhuge Seung Kye. You didnt mean that I was a genius in a different way, right? Indeed, if uncle had sent you those words would certainly be right. Telling me that its a useless talent and to give up. \u2018Haa, hes starting again. Zhuge Seung Kye had shown interest in the Arts of Machinery since he started to learn how to read. He didnt mind about people keeping him back and continued to delve himself deeper into the Arts of Machinery. The scolding of the Zhuge Sega didnt end there and so his confidence turned into insecurity. This was all because of his negative way of thinking. He had been cursed so much that he couldnt believe in compliments. At times he was so simple and easy to soothe but even that faded out and all kinds of negativeness appeared. Little brother, just accept it. You should also know it if you have ears but I am also a freak in Mount Hua. Your good brother must have already told you this, didnt you hear it? Yeah\u2026the only one that speak to me are my uncle and you\u2026 Zhuge Seung Kye answered with dead eyes. Originally Zhuge Sang did speak to him at times but that stopped when he joined with the group of Mount Hua. Zhuge Sang cared about the conversation he had with the members of the Lotus Peak if it was for establishing a connection with Mount Hua sect. Zhuge Suran didnt dislike Zhuge Seung Kye but he didnt speak to him as he was treated like a non-existent person. As that happened, the only ones that spoke to him were Zhuge Sak and Ju Seo Cheon. But most of Zhuge Saks words were scolding. You are so cowardly for having stated the truth! Dont use the truth in a fair way and lets decide victory with lies and schemes! Zhuge Seung Kye started to speak nonsense. \u2018Based on the rumors he was really immature, but for that to be true\u2026Is he really the Late Known Partner of Heaven? It was at a level where it made him uneasy. He had never seen his skills in the Arts of Machinery so at this point it was starting to worry him. \u2018No, lets leave it. Lets believe in him. If I dont do so then who will believe in this freak? Ju Seo Cheon shook his head and shook off his doubts. Whats wrong? Are you crazy? Zhuge Seung Kye looked at Ju Seo Cheon and got away from him. He wanted to hit him. Most martial artists of Weng An came from small and middle sized sects. And the one in command was a first class warrior of the Murim Association. Welcome! The first class warrior, Wang Chil welcomed the arriving reinforcements magnanimously. He was that happy about their existence. When he heard the nickname Fourteenth Gallant Sword tears started to form in his eyes. I have only a vague understanding of the situation so explain. Zhuge Sak said. Yes! Six hundred of the Death Faction and four hundred of the Murim Association. People that didnt know about Murim would think that the Death Faction held the upper hand looking at the difference in forces. But anyone that had a little bit of knowledge about Murim would say that the Murim Association was the one with the upper hand. The forces of the River of Death were so great it could be seen as being overwhelming. But the only overwhelming thing was their number. If you were to pick the most representative characteristic of the Death Factions martial arts was that it was quite fast to complete it but instead, you would face a wall that appeared at a certain section so it was really hard to overcome it. Thats why they had a lot of low leveled martial artists, they had much less experts or middle tier martial artists than the Righteous Faction. Even though their quality was low, they still had numbers so it was hard to determine victory or defeat with just that. Did an expert of the Death Faction come to Weng An? Gu Pung asked directly. If there was a difference of two hundred people, the difference wasnt that great to get pushed back one sidedly. Rather than speaking about defeat, they could be aiming for victory if they did well. But the reason they requested for reinforcements meant that there was another disadvantageous reason besides number. Yes. Three of them. The faces of Gu Pung and Zhuge Sak hardened at Wang Chils answer. Ah, but there are no pinnacle experts so you can rest assured. Someone that could be called an expert had to be at the Pinnacle Rank at least. The boundary beyond that, and especially the top hundred experts inside the Transcendent rank received another nickname. Zhuge Sak let out a sigh of relief and then shouted while getting angry. Tell us about them first! It would be a problem if there was even a peak expert among the three. Not even Gu Pung could be sure of their victory. But if all of them were at the 1st rank, they would somehow be able to take care of them, although it may be bothersome. If they didnt get any obstructions, he would be able to face all three of them. Good, lets check the situation first and then decide on how\u2026 Zhuge Sak was about to set up a strategy. Its an emergency! But he had to stop due to someone yelling. Whats wrong? We received news that the Three Headed Mad Dog have appeared at the second clash and are running wild at the front lines! Even though they were called three headed, it didnt mean that they had three heads. There were three insane brothers that committed all kinds of atrocities and were called the Three Headed Mad Dog. All three of them were at the peak rank. It seems like we wont be having spare time. Gu Pung let out a sigh and stood up from his seat. Gulp. Jang Hong gulped. His face was completely stiff by the tension and it was no different for Jang Seo Eun. Even if they were disciples of Mount Hua, everyone would get nervous at the first real battle they would experience. I will leave the two of them at your care. Gu Pung entrusted the two soldiers that belonged to the Murim Association and had accompanied them since Guiyang. Yes great master. Just leave it to us. Before they left for Guiyang, they had received the role of acting as escorts that would act instead of Gu Pung from Shin Do Gyun. Thanks to that Gu Pung could get a bit relieved. Two? Ju Seo Cheon tilted his head. Umm, im sorry for not having told you beforehand. Gu Pung apologized to Ju Seo Cheon before leaving the tent. I would also like to take you with us but the situation doesnt allow that. It seems like the warriors that have accompanied us since Guiyang wont be able to handle three people. Thats why I have to unavoidably leave you here as the youngest of them. He had no reason to take Ju Seo Cheon to the battlefield so it was unavoidable even if he felt it was unfair. \u2018Mm, I had been looking forward to it so its a bit regretful. He wanted to test the martial arts he had trained in so hard until now. At the Lotus Peak he sparred at times with Nak Seo Wol when she sneaked in but it wasnt that he had shown his true skills. An opportunity to participate in the battlefield had appeared so he was planning to sneak out alone to fight as the battlefield would become chaotic anyways. It was an obvious thing but he didnt feel nervous due to fear like Jang Seo Eun or Jang Hong. Ju Seo Cheon had also managed to stay alive by fighting at the age of war even though he wasnt as great as the heroes. There was no one in Mount Hua that had more real experience than Ju Seo Cheon. It wasnt called the age of war for nothing. It meant that there were THAT many battles. Its a decision I came up with while thinking of your safety so dont think im so heartless. Its not that Im looking down on you. I already know, senior uncle. Thank you for thinking about me. It was an unavoidable decision. Ju Seo Cheon nodded in an understanding way. You are only twelve but you are already grown up. This master of yours has a really good disciple. Ah, the youngest one of the Zhuge Sega will also stay behind so you should take care of him well. I request this to you. Yes, senior uncle. Take care out there. I will pray for your safety. A place called Kae An appeared after walking half a day from Weng An. It was a region where small regions were gathered at. This place was at the boundary region between the Murim Association and the River of Death and was a place that occurred several times in a day. The reinforcements that departed from Weng Ang marched the fastest they could and arrived at Kae Ang. Waaaaa! Its the Fourteenth Gallant Sword. As soon as Gu Pung made his appearance, cheers that were so loud it could burst your eardrums exploded among the warriors of the Murim Association. The name of the Fourteenth Gallant Sword was that reliable. Even the River of Death flinched at that spirit. Gu Pung stood at the front line and displayed the Fourteen Stances of the Plum Blossom Sword. The sword of a pinnacle rank wasnt normal at all. Warriors of the Death Faction screamed everytime his sword passed by and blood was sprayed. Haha, they are nothing much! Zhuge Sak observed the battlefield and laughed. There was no need to even set up a plan. The Fourteenth Gallant Sword and all the forces that came from Kae Yang boasted a burning martial prowess. \u2026\u2026\u2026brother. Zhuge Suran looked at the battlefield and called Zhuge Sang. Right. Zhuge Sang opened his eyes sharply. He spoke first before Zhuge Suran even spoke. There are a few of them. Sweat dropped from the forehead of Zhuge Sang. Its difficult to check exactly because it is a dog fight but\u2026there are about a hundred to a hundred and fifty people less on the side of the Death Faction. Zhuge Sang turned around slowly and checked his back. The direction he was looking at was towards the tent at Weng An. Uncle, it seems like we fell in a trap. There are about a hundred to a hundred and fifty troops less. Hahaha, what are you saying? It seems like you made a misunderstanding because it hasnt been long since you entered the battlefield. Moreover, look at the front. The River of Death isnt able to fight back at all and are dying! Zhuge Sang turned gloomy. Zhuge Sak and the Weng An warriors were already drunk on victory and couldnt see anything. They threw themselves at the soaring morale and yelled towards the martial artists of the Death Faction.

Its not even a battle between the Righteous and Death faction so why is Guizhou the only place that isnt peaceful and is always at war? Zhuge Seung Kye mumbled with a doubtful voice. It wasnt that a battle occurred for a short while, it continued for tens of years. Murim was maintaining peace because of the balance of power and war didnt occur because of that so it was weird why only Guizhou was like this. Guizhou is a balance that differentiates the territory of the Righteous and Death faction. Even if they had agreed to a ceasefire agreement, it was obvious as to what would happen if you left martial artists together while fretting for not having been able to kill each other in the front lines. Ju Seo Cheon cleared up Zhuge Seung Kyes doubts. \u2018I heard that he was only interested in the Arts of Machinery. To think that the rumor was true. He doesnt know anything about the situation in Murim. I will have to engrave it in his head even if I have to use force later. It will be troublesome if he doesnt even have the basic knowledge. He would have loved to scold him and tell him to at least memorize that much but he had to get close with him now. There is no need to stimulate a kid that is filled with enmity and caution. No matter how you try to control them, martial artists have favor and spite. That monster-like emotion paralyzes even your rationality and this is the result of that. Ju Seo Cheon put on a smile that didnt suit his age. Guizhou is a place that is especially like that. It Favored spite endlessly until it became uncontrollable. It means that no one is able to cut this cycle you genius. Ahemm, genius? Your intentions are too obvious but it doesnt feel bad. Zhuge Seung Kyes lips curled up until it reached his ear globes. \u2018Huhu, simple brat. Ju Seo Cheon smiled inwardly. Kids were beings that were easy to handle. \u2026Wait. A shadow was cast on the face of the smiling Zhuge Seung Kye. You didnt mean that I was a genius in a different way, right? Indeed, if uncle had sent you those words would certainly be right. Telling me that its a useless talent and to give up. \u2018Haa, hes starting again. Zhuge Seung Kye had shown interest in the Arts of Machinery since he started to learn how to read. He didnt mind about people keeping him back and continued to delve himself deeper into the Arts of Machinery. The scolding of the Zhuge Sega didnt end there and so his confidence turned into insecurity. This was all because of his negative way of thinking. He had been cursed so much that he couldnt believe in compliments. At times he was so simple and easy to soothe but even that faded out and all kinds of negativeness appeared. Little brother, just accept it. You should also know it if you have ears but I am also a freak in Mount Hua. Your good brother must have already told you this, didnt you hear it? Yeah\u2026the only one that speak to me are my uncle and you\u2026 Zhuge Seung Kye answered with dead eyes. Originally Zhuge Sang did speak to him at times but that stopped when he joined with the group of Mount Hua. Zhuge Sang cared about the conversation he had with the members of the Lotus Peak if it was for establishing a connection with Mount Hua sect. Zhuge Suran didnt dislike Zhuge Seung Kye but he didnt speak to him as he was treated like a non-existent person. As that happened, the only ones that spoke to him were Zhuge Sak and Ju Seo Cheon. But most of Zhuge Saks words were scolding. You are so cowardly for having stated the truth! Dont use the truth in a fair way and lets decide victory with lies and schemes! Zhuge Seung Kye started to speak nonsense. \u2018Based on the rumors he was really immature, but for that to be true\u2026Is he really the Late Known Partner of Heaven? It was at a level where it made him uneasy. He had never seen his skills in the Arts of Machinery so at this point it was starting to worry him. \u2018No, lets leave it. Lets believe in him. If I dont do so then who will believe in this freak? Ju Seo Cheon shook his head and shook off his doubts. Whats wrong? Are you crazy? Zhuge Seung Kye looked at Ju Seo Cheon and got away from him. He wanted to hit him. Most martial artists of Weng An came from small and middle sized sects. And the one in command was a first class warrior of the Murim Association. Welcome! The first class warrior, Wang Chil welcomed the arriving reinforcements magnanimously. He was that happy about their existence. When he heard the nickname Fourteenth Gallant Sword tears started to form in his eyes. I have only a vague understanding of the situation so explain. Zhuge Sak said. Yes! Six hundred of the Death Faction and four hundred of the Murim Association. People that didnt know about Murim would think that the Death Faction held the upper hand looking at the difference in forces. But anyone that had a little bit of knowledge about Murim would say that the Murim Association was the one with the upper hand. The forces of the River of Death were so great it could be seen as being overwhelming. But the only overwhelming thing was their number. If you were to pick the most representative characteristic of the Death Factions martial arts was that it was quite fast to complete it but instead, you would face a wall that appeared at a certain section so it was really hard to overcome it. Thats why they had a lot of low leveled martial artists, they had much less experts or middle tier martial artists than the Righteous Faction. Even though their quality was low, they still had numbers so it was hard to determine victory or defeat with just that. Did an expert of the Death Faction come to Weng An? Gu Pung asked directly. If there was a difference of two hundred people, the difference wasnt that great to get pushed back one sidedly. Rather than speaking about defeat, they could be aiming for victory if they did well. But the reason they requested for reinforcements meant that there was another disadvantageous reason besides number. Yes. Three of them. The faces of Gu Pung and Zhuge Sak hardened at Wang Chils answer. Ah, but there are no pinnacle experts so you can rest assured. Someone that could be called an expert had to be at the Pinnacle Rank at least. The boundary beyond that, and especially the top hundred experts inside the Transcendent rank received another nickname. Zhuge Sak let out a sigh of relief and then shouted while getting angry. Tell us about them first! It would be a problem if there was even a peak expert among the three. Not even Gu Pung could be sure of their victory. But if all of them were at the 1st rank, they would somehow be able to take care of them, although it may be bothersome. If they didnt get any obstructions, he would be able to face all three of them. Good, lets check the situation first and then decide on how\u2026 Zhuge Sak was about to set up a strategy. Its an emergency! But he had to stop due to someone yelling. Whats wrong? We received news that the Three Headed Mad Dog have appeared at the second clash and are running wild at the front lines! Even though they were called three headed, it didnt mean that they had three heads. There were three insane brothers that committed all kinds of atrocities and were called the Three Headed Mad Dog. All three of them were at the peak rank. It seems like we wont be having spare time. Gu Pung let out a sigh and stood up from his seat. Gulp. Jang Hong gulped. His face was completely stiff by the tension and it was no different for Jang Seo Eun. Even if they were disciples of Mount Hua, everyone would get nervous at the first real battle they would experience. I will leave the two of them at your care. Gu Pung entrusted the two soldiers that belonged to the Murim Association and had accompanied them since Guiyang. Yes great master. Just leave it to us. Before they left for Guiyang, they had received the role of acting as escorts that would act instead of Gu Pung from Shin Do Gyun. Thanks to that Gu Pung could get a bit relieved. Two? Ju Seo Cheon tilted his head. Umm, im sorry for not having told you beforehand. Gu Pung apologized to Ju Seo Cheon before leaving the tent. I would also like to take you with us but the situation doesnt allow that. It seems like the warriors that have accompanied us since Guiyang wont be able to handle three people. Thats why I have to unavoidably leave you here as the youngest of them. He had no reason to take Ju Seo Cheon to the battlefield so it was unavoidable even if he felt it was unfair. \u2018Mm, I had been looking forward to it so its a bit regretful. He wanted to test the martial arts he had trained in so hard until now. At the Lotus Peak he sparred at times with Nak Seo Wol when she sneaked in but it wasnt that he had shown his true skills. An opportunity to participate in the battlefield had appeared so he was planning to sneak out alone to fight as the battlefield would become chaotic anyways. It was an obvious thing but he didnt feel nervous due to fear like Jang Seo Eun or Jang Hong. Ju Seo Cheon had also managed to stay alive by fighting at the age of war even though he wasnt as great as the heroes. There was no one in Mount Hua that had more real experience than Ju Seo Cheon. It wasnt called the age of war for nothing. It meant that there were THAT many battles. Its a decision I came up with while thinking of your safety so dont think im so heartless. Its not that Im looking down on you. I already know, senior uncle. Thank you for thinking about me. It was an unavoidable decision. Ju Seo Cheon nodded in an understanding way. You are only twelve but you are already grown up. This master of yours has a really good disciple. Ah, the youngest one of the Zhuge Sega will also stay behind so you should take care of him well. I request this to you. Yes, senior uncle. Take care out there. I will pray for your safety. A place called Kae An appeared after walking half a day from Weng An. It was a region where small regions were gathered at. This place was at the boundary region between the Murim Association and the River of Death and was a place that occurred several times in a day. The reinforcements that departed from Weng Ang marched the fastest they could and arrived at Kae Ang. Waaaaa! Its the Fourteenth Gallant Sword. As soon as Gu Pung made his appearance, cheers that were so loud it could burst your eardrums exploded among the warriors of the Murim Association. The name of the Fourteenth Gallant Sword was that reliable. Even the River of Death flinched at that spirit. Gu Pung stood at the front line and displayed the Fourteen Stances of the Plum Blossom Sword. The sword of a pinnacle rank wasnt normal at all. Warriors of the Death Faction screamed everytime his sword passed by and blood was sprayed. Haha, they are nothing much! Zhuge Sak observed the battlefield and laughed. There was no need to even set up a plan. The Fourteenth Gallant Sword and all the forces that came from Kae Yang boasted a burning martial prowess. \u2026\u2026\u2026brother. Zhuge Suran looked at the battlefield and called Zhuge Sang. Right. Zhuge Sang opened his eyes sharply. He spoke first before Zhuge Suran even spoke. There are a few of them.

Their worries had turned into reality. The warriors of Weng An had left the place due to the appearance of the Three Headed Mad Dog. The remaining ones were only the injured, women and kids. And there were also a few low ranked warriors protecting them. Wh, what is that! A warrior that was standing on the watchtower screamed and then, the warrior that was at the opposite side turned his eyes to look at what was going on. Agh! Its the River of Death! They could see a group of the River of Death approaching from a distance. There were at least a hundred and at most a hundred and fifty of them. The warriors saw them and realized that the appearance of the Three Headed Mad Dog was just bait. But it was already too late. Uh, what do we do? All the people that had the authority to command had gone out to battle. And the strongest of them was a second rate warrior that had just become one. There were a few high ranked warriors among the injured but they havent even regained consciousness. We, we have to escape! There were about thirty warriors if you included the people that were slightly injured and the warriors that could somewhat move. On top of that, the strongest person in this group was a second rate martial artist. They wouldnt be able to defeat the group of a hundred with these numbers at all. What do we do with the injured, the women and the children? Someone asked and the atmosphere became heavy at those words. It felt like something was about to break down from their chests but that was only unavoidable speaking realistically. While they were thinking about what they should do, a kid that seemed like he had just become an adult walked towards them. Oh my, I never thought that it would be a decoy. The kid, Ju Seo Cheon, jumped high and climbed the watchtower. The martial artists got surprised and opened a path. Hm, there are about a hundred of them. There may be experts among them but there is no way that is true as senior uncle is out in the battlefield. Ju Seo Cheon crossed his arms and fell in thought. The warriors that were looking at Ju Seo Cheon below the watchtower showed various reactions. Thats right! We had a disciple of Mount Hua! On top of that he belongs to the Lotus Peak! We are saved! You idiot, that kid is only twelve even if he looks like that! What? The people that had extended their arms and became happy put on confused expressions when they heard that the kid was only twelve. Part of it was because he was bigger than kids his age but also because the atmosphere around him was quite mature. Sob sob sob! Why are you so slow on catching up? That kid is the flashy yet frail one. He is a useless guy that has ignorantly high internal energy but is completely empty besides that! Another third rate warrior pulled out the hair from his head and despaired. We are all dead! Will they spare us if we surrender? Didnt the geniuses of the Zhuge Sega also come? So why werent they able to think of this being a bait! The warriors stuck together and despaired. They started to curse out as they fell into a desperate situation. Ju Seo Cheon looked down at the martial artists that were filled with chaos and despair from the watchtower and smirked. There were countless cases where they gave up on their base at the age of war and escaped when they fell into a trap. They also left behind the injured, the women and the children saying that they hindered them on their escape. Compared to that, the third rate warriors of this place didnt escape even if they did curse their fate. Even if your martial arts is at the third rate it doesnt mean that your hearts are the same. Thats merely a prejudice. Look how excellent they are. Ha, but I am so unlucky. Ju Seo Cheon stopped laughing and his brows curved. He formed a smile praising the actions of the martial artists but his situation wasnt that good. \u2018If I exclude the injured there are twenty third rate warriors and one second rate warrior. Theres too few. They didnt know what kind of strategy the enemy had but it was hard to fight with this number coupled with the fact that their morale was at an all time low. \u2018If its those geniuses, they may notice that this is a trap. Im sure they will send reinforcements so I just have to hold on until then. Ju Seo Cheon came down from the watchtower and checked his surroundings. Everyone was despairing saying that they would die today. \u2018\u2026. Originally the place in this place should have been annihilated because they fell on the bait or got caught as hostages\u2026probably. The person called Ju Seo Cheon wasnt originally at this place. It was an obvious thing as he didnt belong to the Lotus Peak. It was the same for Zhuge Seung Kye. He shouldnt be here originally. In the beginning Zhuge Sak was planning on only showing the battlefield to Zhuge Seung Kye but Zhuge Sang had stopped him saying \u2018Uncle. The situation isnt good so it would be better to leave him behind. Isnt there fellow disciple Ju?. Even though he had an overwhelming amount of internal energy, in Zhuge Sangs opinion Ju Seo Cheon was more normal than Zhuge Seung Kye. It seemed like he had proper concepts compared to his age so they were able to trust and leave it to him. \u2018It seems like he heard the commotion and hid himself. Well, thats for the better. I didnt think that he would fight anyways. Zhuge Seung Kye couldnt practice martial arts. He had learned an energy circulating method but that was only at the second star. How could he tell him to fight with just that? It was doubtful whether he would even be able to defeat a normal person. He would only hinder him down so it would be better to just stay hidden. Now, shall we start? Sruuung. Ju Seo Cheon pulled out his sword. The gates of Weng An got crushed with a loud sound. Several warriors among the River of Death tried to enter through the door that wasnt that big. Kyaak! The nurse that was treating the injured, screamed. Her face that didnt even blink once after seeing blood. Kuahaha! Come here! The warrior of the Death Faction that was at the forefront yelled. Their characteristic was that they had messy beards as if they were mountain bandits. I am Mak Won Gap, the one that even makes crying children stop\u2026 huh? What is this brat? Mak Won Gap looked in front of him with a dumbfounded expression. Inside the manor, the one that looked like he had just become an adult, Ju Seo Cheon was standing with his sword hanging low and looking at the infiltrators. I dont need to state my name to someone that will die anyways. Ju Seo Cheon raised his sword and took a stance. What? Kuhahaha! Mak Won Gap burst out in laughter at Ju Seo Cheons words. His laugh was filled half with outrageousness and sneer. Brat, are you planning on facing us alone? No. Im not alone. Ju Seo Cheon raised his left hand. And then, about twenty third rate warriors came out and surrounded the entrance. \u2018Damn. Mak Won Gap realized his mistake. There were still many warriors that hadnt been able to cross the gate yet and were following from behind. They knew that there was no one left in Weng An to fight them so they all took their time. There were about fifteen people that appeared from the gate and they were all uselessly big so there was not much space either. Defending position. Thud. The third rate warriors changed their postures at Ju Seo Cheons orders. They were all filled with nervousness and uneasiness. I compliment you on having used the gate but dont think that you will be able to stop us. Mak Won Gap put on an uneasy expression for a short instant and then put on a smile that was filled with confidence. There shouldnt be any experts inside Weng An so there was no need to be scared. Brat, I was a bit flustered at how bold you were. I will let you repent for your sin of having seen us lightly with this sword! Mak Won Gap pointed at Ju Seo Cheon with the point of his sword. Strike! Waaaa! The martial artists belonging to theRiver of Death shouted. The warriors that were gathered at the gate swung their swords in a threatening way. The warriors of Weng An hesitated but they realized that they had nowhere to run to and exchanged sword blows desperately. Brat, im wondering about why you are acting so confidently! The biggest man among the River of Death broke out from the encirclement and charged like a boar. He didnt have the fangs of a boar but instead was holding a crude blade. Die! A sword came flying towards him. From his torso to his lower body. It was a blade technique that drew a clean straight line. That swing wasnt great at all. It was merely at the third rate level. His eyes closed up and the world flowed slowly. The sound of the surroundings passed his eardrums and rang in his brain. Waaaaaa! A really short instant. The memories of the past passed in that short moment and influenced his surroundings. The age of war. An age where they only knew how to fight. Corpses formed a mountain and blood formed a river. When he got a hold of himself he saw himself standing in that place. His clothes were dyed with blood that he couldnt know who it belonged to. He was holding a sword and his legs trembled. He could see the back of someone. It was the back of a hero. \u2018I have only seen their backs until now. He had seen the reliable back of someone. Someone he couldnt distinguish whether it belonged to a man or a woman. Or if it even belonged to an old man, a kid or an adult. But the only thing he could know was that that back had felt like such a huge mountain. But now. Ju Seo Cheon put more strength in his sword. Haha, did you get so scared that you are pissing yourself! The big warrior looked at Ju Seo Cheon that was standing still and laughed. I\u2026 Ju Seo Cheon raised the internal energy from his dantian. The internal energy he obtained from the Plum Blossom displayed an explosive power. The internal energy that came out from his dantian flowed through his solid veins and blood vessels and headed to the sword that was connected with his hand. It somewhat felt like they could sense the scent of the Plum Blossom. Will be that back. Slaaaaash! Huh? The sword split the wind and drew a line. It was a line that was drawn in a perfect straight line. That line shone in a white light and then burned in a red light and transformed into a line of blood. The sword of the big bodied martial artist stopped in the air. His eyes turned round. It seemed like he didnt know what was going to happen to him. The crown of his head split and a line of blood was formed up to his crotch. Thud. Water drops fell from his crotch. No, it was blood. Blood flowed from his unseemly chest. Impossib\u2026. He couldnt finish what he was about to say. Riiiiip! The body of the big man couldnt endure it any longer. His body split in two like lumber and fell down. Silence filled the battlefield at that moment. The warriors of Weng An, that were stopping the River of Death desperately in an encirclement, and even their enemies didnt understand what had happened. Plum Blossom Alongside The Road. Ju Seo Cheon took a defensive stance without moving and mumbled. Plum Blossom Dancing Like a Butterfly. Ju Seo Cheons body had seemingly disappeared. He moved at a speed that third rates couldnt follow with their eyes. Ju Seo Cheon dug into the group of the River of Death and spun around in a flashy way. Plum Blossom Releasing Smoke. Ju Seo Cheon swung his sword. An aura that couldnt be seen with the eye swayed in the sword and passed through the surroundings. There were three River of Death fodder in his surroundings. Plum Blossom Blooming Sharply. And that aura blossomed in full bloom and released a fierce aura. A certain something stabbed the three men. Kyaaaak! The three warriors of the River of Death screamed and collapsed backwardly. If you saw in detail you could see holes in various parts of their bodies like in their chests. Wh, what are you? Bak Won Gaps voice trembled. No one in this place noticed which ascending sword technique he used. What are you! Bak Won Gap opened his eyes widely and yelled. Ju Seo Cheon dusted off the blood in his sword and cleaned it. The martial artists of Weng An stared at Ju Seo Cheon dumbfoundedly. His back was small yet seemed enormous. Im a passing\u2026. Ju Seo Cheons mouth curled up. Sword Examiner of Mount Hua! This translation belongs to Centinni. Join us now on our discord server: https://discord. gg/NXzNRqg.

Strike! Waaaa! The martial artists belonging to theRiver of Death shouted. The warriors that were gathered at the gate swung their swords in a threatening way. The warriors of Weng An hesitated but they realized that they had nowhere to run to and exchanged sword blows desperately. Brat, im wondering about why you are acting so confidently! The biggest man among the River of Death broke out from the encirclement and charged like a boar. He didnt have the fangs of a boar but instead was holding a crude blade. Die! A sword came flying towards him. From his torso to his lower body. It was a blade technique that drew a clean straight line. That swing wasnt great at all. It was merely at the third rate level. His eyes closed up and the world flowed slowly. The sound of the surroundings passed his eardrums and rang in his brain. Waaaaaa! A really short instant. The memories of the past passed in that short moment and influenced his surroundings. The age of war. An age where they only knew how to fight. Corpses formed a mountain and blood formed a river. When he got a hold of himself he saw himself standing in that place. His clothes were dyed with blood that he couldnt know who it belonged to. He was holding a sword and his legs trembled. He could see the back of someone. It was the back of a hero. \u2018I have only seen their backs until now. He had seen the reliable back of someone. Someone he couldnt distinguish whether it belonged to a man or a woman. Or if it even belonged to an old man, a kid or an adult. But the only thing he could know was that that back had felt like such a huge mountain. But now. Ju Seo Cheon put more strength in his sword. Haha, did you get so scared that you are pissing yourself! The big warrior looked at Ju Seo Cheon that was standing still and laughed. I\u2026 Ju Seo Cheon raised the internal energy from his dantian. The internal energy he obtained from the Plum Blossom displayed an explosive power. The internal energy that came out from his dantian flowed through his solid veins and blood vessels and headed to the sword that was connected with his hand. It somewhat felt like they could sense the scent of the Plum Blossom. Will be that back. Slaaaaash! Huh? The sword split the wind and drew a line. It was a line that was drawn in a perfect straight line. That line shone in a white light and then burned in a red light and transformed into a line of blood. The sword of the big bodied martial artist stopped in the air. His eyes turned round. It seemed like he didnt know what was going to happen to him. The crown of his head split and a line of blood was formed up to his crotch. Thud. Water drops fell from his crotch. No, it was blood. Blood flowed from his unseemly chest. Impossib\u2026. He couldnt finish what he was about to say. Riiiiip! The body of the big man couldnt endure it any longer. His body split in two like lumber and fell down. Silence filled the battlefield at that moment. The warriors of Weng An, that were stopping the River of Death desperately in an encirclement, and even their enemies didnt understand what had happened. Plum Blossom Alongside The Road. Ju Seo Cheon took a defensive stance without moving and mumbled. Plum Blossom Dancing Like a Butterfly. Ju Seo Cheons body had seemingly disappeared. He moved at a speed that third rates couldnt follow with their eyes. Ju Seo Cheon dug into the group of the River of Death and spun around in a flashy way. Plum Blossom Releasing Smoke. Ju Seo Cheon swung his sword. An aura that couldnt be seen with the eye swayed in the sword and passed through the surroundings. There were three River of Death fodder in his surroundings. Plum Blossom Blooming Sharply. And that aura blossomed in full bloom and released a fierce aura. A certain something stabbed the three men. Kyaaaak! The three warriors of the River of Death screamed and collapsed backwardly. If you saw in detail you could see holes in various parts of their bodies like in their chests. Wh, what are you? Bak Won Gaps voice trembled. No one in this place noticed which ascending sword technique he used. What are you! Bak Won Gap opened his eyes widely and yelled. Ju Seo Cheon dusted off the blood in his sword and cleaned it. The martial artists of Weng An stared at Ju Seo Cheon dumbfoundedly. His back was small yet seemed enormous. Im a passing\u2026. Ju Seo Cheons mouth curled up. Sword Examiner of Mount Hua! This translation belongs to Centinni. Join us now on our discord server: https://discord. gg/NXzNRqg.

His target was Mak Won Gap. Wh, what are you doing! Mak Won Gap got scared and stepped back. The courage he had shown when he first entered couldnt be seen anymore. Get rid of that bastard first! The nickname of brat had changed into bastard. Hy, hyung-nim. He says that he is a Sword Examiner of Mount Hua. The one that got to stand at the forefront after the death of the big guy spoke in a scared voice. His body was trembling slightly. Mount Hua. That name was terror itself for low leveled martial artists of the River of Death. Al, also, obviously hes not even twenty yet\u2026 Hes a member of the Lotus Peak without a doubt! Everyone here knew what it meant when someone that wasnt even twenty came out to Kang Ho. If we touch the Lotus Peak\u2026: Someone spoke carefully. A member of the Lotus Peak was someone that received special treatment even inside of Mount Hua. It was hard to touch him as they were scared of the aftermath. You idiots! Mak Won Gap raised his voice with a red face. Blue veins had appeared in his neck. So are you planning on retreating here? Anyone knows that this place only has injured people, if we escape we will obviously be a laughing stock and our lives will end right here! They had separated a hundred warriors for the decoy. It meant that the damages the main troop would suffer would obviously increase. They had to pass through here somehow, take over this place and take the families of the people at Weng An as disciples. And you, disciple of Mount Hua. No, member of the Lotus Peak, you are still a child in the end! Mak Won Gap kicked the back of a warrior that was trying to pull out. In the first place, not having followed the Fourteenth Gallant Sword means that his skills are lacking! Dont be scared and suppress him quickly, you useless bastards! Maybe they got persuaded by Mak Won Gaps yell or they became scared that the warriors of the River of Death raised their swords again. Most of them were looking at Ju Seo Cheon. Why is it that you speak more than the Righteous Faction? Ju Seo Cheon contained his laughter and put more strength in his hand holding the sword. Stop babbling and speak with your sword! After Ju Seo Cheon stopped speaking the warriors of both sides clashed once again. Remember the words of young master Ju! The second rate martial artist that had been assisting the places that got pierced through or were having a hard time, yelled. Thirty minutes ago, Ju Seo Cheon had taken the third and second rate martial artists and set up a brief strategy. At first, the warriors didnt even try to listen to him because they thought that Ju Seo Cheon was useless. But Ju Seo Cheon said, I will spread that you tried to escape alone while trying to take and escape with the properties but you failed and died. If you are warriors that have families to protect, you will know what will happen to that family of yours, right? A demon, a demon is here! \u2026. And threatened them like that. Most of them had already given up on despair so they decided to follow Ju Seo Cheon without complaining much. Actually, it wasnt something that could be called a strategy. It was simply blackmail. They had to surround the gate so that not every enemy could enter. In addition, the second rate martial artists would assist the places that got opened. Lastly, Ju Seo Cheon would defeat the warriors that belonged to the River of Death one by one in the center of the battlefield. When they first heard that tactic the warriors thought that Ju Seo Cheon was crazy, that he was being too overconfident. It was obvious to think like that. He was only a twelve year old kid, even though he belonged to the Lotus Peak. On top of that, it was his first time in Murim. They didnt know how he would act after his first murder but he wanted them to leave everything to him. All their rationality had escaped far away. The enemy warriors got closer before they could even object and in the end all of them despaired and proceeded with the tactic. But what was this? The tactic was a success. No, the tactic wasnt the problem. The power Ju Seo Cheon showed was just too shocking. At first, everyone just blinked and doubted their eyes. But they finally got able to believe it after Ju Seo Cheon defeated three more warriors after the first one. They didnt know how this happened. It was a martial power that exceeded common sense. They werent able to hide their happiness when they got hope of being able to get out of this place alive. Left wing, you are delving in too deeply so be careful! I understand how you feel but we have fewer numbers so calm down a bit! Ju Seo Cheon checked the situation even while swinging his sword. He had a bit of commanding experience due to his past life, although not much. Yes! The third rate warriors answered in a dignified way. The despair that was filling them up until then had disappeared. They were fewer in numbers and their morale had fallen to the bottom. There was no hope. . There were injured people behind them. The people that couldnt fight were trembling in fright while hiding. They were embarrassed for having thought for a moment of leaving them behind so they reflected on that and moved. \u2018There it is. The third rate warriors saw it. \u2018The back of the third rate warriors is there. A back that was more reliable than any others. The back of a kid that wasnt even 20 yet. It may be a bit embarrassing but they relied on the back of that kid and fought fiercely by following his orders. Die! A warrior belonging to the River of Death yelled and charged forward. Ju Seo Cheon pulled out the sword that was stuck in the chest of an enemy warrior by his side and then swung his sword by twisting his body. Swuuuung! A sharp sound exploded and the sword soaked in blood drew a straight line. Huup! The Apostle of Death warrior bent back his head as if he expected it. The tip of the sword grazed by his neck with a thin margin. Hahaha! Its the end! The warrior yelled out in joy. No matter how outstanding one was, it would take time to retrieve your sword so he tried to swing his sword hard even before his head turned to its original place. Ho, you are quite good. Ju Seo Cheon complimented him and put strength in his legs. The well trained muscles in his legs swelled up. And then, circulated internal energy to the end of his legs and kicked the shin of the warrior with all his strength. Graaaagh! A sound of something breaking was heard. The warrior got his leg broken even before he swung his sword. The, the one that calls himself a Sword Examiner of Mount Hua\u2026! Disciples that belonged to the Righteous Faction, and especially the ones that had strong pride on their sword like Mount Hua, tried not to use arts besides swordsmanship. Even if they had the Plum Blossom Fist Techniques, there were some that commited suicide at the shame they felt of losing their sword while fighting. On top of that, the opponent of the warrior was the peak of Mount Hua, that was said to be the pride of Mount Hua. He couldnt understand him launching a kick. Even I dont use it much except for really dangerous situations. And after facing war, even the prideful martial artists of the Righteous Faction would lose their pride by quite a bit . Ju Seo Cheon was also one of those types. But his way of thinking changed after having almost experienced death and in really desperate situations. That wasnt only for Ju Seo Cheon. Martial artists of the Righteous faction that had a solid way of thinking also faced several changes after going through the age of war. Save\u2026 What? I cant hear you because you belong to the River of Death. Slash! The head of the warrior got separated from his body. Hiiik! The warriors of the River of Death that were about to breakthrough got terrified and the faces of the warriors behind them also turned pale. They were third rate in the first place. They couldnt demonstrate their skills in front of an overwhelming power. In the case of martial artists belonging to the Death Faction, such things like pride and honor didnt really matter. Fear spread in an instant. Th, thirty people were killed by that kid! Someone got terrified and screamed. The hundred warriors got reduced to seventy. Think differently! He will be undoubtedly exhausted because he fought against thirty people with his life on the line! Mak Won Gap yelled desperately. \u2018I cant fall back here. I dont know about others but if I, the person in charge, escapes I will certainly be chased down. Mak Won Gap gulped down. It was easy for the person in charge to accumulate merits but the punishment they suffered wasnt light either. It was even more so for the River of Death, that didnt care about circumstances. Push! Push! Push him back! Mak Won Gap kicked the back of his subordinates. He raised his sword and shouted in a loud voice. I will report to my superiors so that you receive a gold plate to the one that gets me his head! Mak Won Gap didnt have that much authority. He had just babbled on because he was being pressed by fear. Uwaaaa! The warriors of the River of Death reacted to the word gold plate. In the case of the Death Faction and especially the ones that lived a low class lives tended to lose their minds at material things like money, rather than honor or pride. Th, this! The second rate martial artist of Weng An turned pale. They were holding on well but it became hard to endure as the warriors of the River of Death charged together in an agitated state. Until now they were showing a passive attitude because they saw Ju Seo Cheons overwhelming power but it became the opposite now. Yo, young master Ju! The second rate martial artists called out Ju Seo Cheon in a pledging voice. The third rate martial artists also hesitated and started to get pushed back. \u2018Damn! Ju Seo Cheon tried to turn back. Dieeee! But the warriors of the River of Death gathered over to stop Ju Seo Cheon. They werent that threatening but it was difficult to go and reinforce others. Someones voice rang the battlefield when the encirclement was about to get broken through. Hey you bastards! Boom! An unknown explosion was heard. Fwoooosh! Something fell above the heads of the warriors of the River of Death before they could even grasp the identity of the sound. Guaaaak! Aghh, where did this come from! Screams were heard everywhere. The warriors that were charging like boars got scared. The things that fell above their heads were arrows. And there were at least twenty raining down on them all at once. \u2026. Hahaha! Ju Seo Cheon also became a target for the arrows as he was in the middle of enemy grounds but he just fended them off with his sword. His eyes were looking at Zhuge Seung Kye, who was holding up a bamboo barrel that was tied with ropes. These Zhuge Sega bastards are so dirty. The Bamboo Crossbow. It was a weapon that fired several arrows after placing arrows inside the bamboo barrel and pulling a string. So, that means\u2026 Seung Kye developed an assassination weapon and they were embarrassed of that as members of the Righteous Sect so they went and sold it off to the Sichuan Family? Haha! I succeeded! Zhuge Seung Kye raised his bamboo crossbow and raised his arms in joy. It was pure happiness of having succeeded in a challenge. \u2018He is with no doubt the Late Known Partner of Heaven!","title":"volcanic-25"},{"location":"volcanic-25/#vocanic-age-chapter-25","text":"Editor: Imagine Ju Seo Cheon yelled heroically and charged forward.

Due to this People thought that he had gotten scared and hid himself. But that wasnt the case at all. It was the opposite. Rather than hiding, Zhuge Seung Kye gathered objects like arrows and bamboo barrels to make an assassination weapon. An, an assassination weapon? Mak Won Gap got bewildered. \u2018The Sichuan Family? It was a weapon he had never seen or heard of before. The only people that would use that kind of assassination weapon were the ones that belonged to the Sichuan Family. Haha, its a success! A success! Zhuge Seung Kye jumped in joy and cheered. Well done Zhuge Seung Kye! Ju Seo Cheon called out Zhuge Seung Kyes name out loud on purpose. It was so that everyone in the surroundings was able to hear him. The Zhuge family? Mak Won Gap asked back with a surprised face. No, why would the Zhuge Sega use assassination weapons? The Righteous Faction considered that using assassination tools was a disgrace, except for the Sichuan Family. Even if it wasnt practicing it and helping others use it, the four factions penalized it greatly. Huk! Th, they saw me! Zhuge Seung Kye stopped jumping in joy and got bewildered. This was the first time he had gotten so much attention that he felt his hands tremble and his heart sink. Cold sweat dripped from his forehead and his mind turned white. Wh, what are you looking at! I also know that im useless! His negative way of thinking had returned. Zhuge Seung Kye embraced the bamboo crossbow and got teary. It was a hard situation for a kid that was only ten. In addition, he hadnt trained in martial arts properly so he wasnt able to hold it when the warriors of the River of Death looked at him menacingly. For the Zhuge Sega to use assassination weapons, how cowardly! You should be ashamed! Mak Won Gaps eyes turned red and yelled. Hah. The second rate warrior of Weng An looked at Mak Won Gap dumbfoundedly and the third rate warriors also showed similar reactions to him. The River of Death was a group that didnt care about honor if it meant winning. But Mak Won Gap didnt care about their gazes and continued to criticize Zhuge Seung Kye. Dont fight like that from up there and lets have a fair square fight! \u2018Thats dangerous. Mak Won Gap got cautious of the bamboo crossbow. The warriors that got fired a while ago werent life threatening but it was still troublesome. He didnt have the leisure to mind those arrows. If he did, he would have been killed by Ju Seo Cheon. \u2018In addition, martial artists of the Righteous Faction would give up their heads by their own if you tell them its cowardly. Theres no way he wont fall for it. Mak Won Gap was sure of it. Wasnt it you who came to attack a small group with a big one? Now youre pointing out what is right and wrong. Have some shame. Ju Seo Cheon stepped forward as if that wouldnt work and smirked. Seung Kye, it has become certain with this. You are clearly a genius. Thats why you should serve me as your older brother. You are spouting nonsense again. Zhuge Seung Kye put on a tired expression. Attack! Mak Won Gaps voice rang resonantly. A third rate warrior holding a sword charged towards him. He had quite a confident expression but he was so slow it made Ju Seo Cheon yawn. Die! The third rate warrior yelled energetically and swung his sword. Ju Seo Cheon took a step to his left and dodged it lightly. \u2018Plum Blossom Brilliant Sword Art! Ju Seo Cheons blade moved so fast that to the average warrior it had simply disappeared. Huk! The third rate warrior stared at the sword with a surprised look but it was too late. Great pain was felt in his solar plexus and blood poured out. This brat! This time two warriors attacked him from both sides. Ju Seo Cheon held his sword more tightly and got satisfied. \u2018I have been training constantly so I was worried if I wasnt able to use it in real combat, so Im glad that isnt the case. He had succeeded in the Fourteen Stances of the Plum Blossom Sword and the Plum Blossom Brilliant Sword Art without much problems. This time, Ju Seo Cheon took a defensive posture and executed the Five Elements Plum Blossom Sword Art. The Five Elements Plum Blossom Sword Art, that contained the five elements, was a martial art that circulated defensive and offensive attacks naturally. It was a sword technique that immediately let you attack after having defended. The sharp sound of wind being split was heard from both sides and swords came flying towards him. However, Ju Seo Cheon lightly fended them off. Ugh! A third rate warrior couldnt hold his weight and fell to his right and the other third rate warrior that was attacking from the right got bewildered. One. He swung his sword horizontally and cleanly cut off the heads of the warriors that were at his right. Ju Seo Cheon twisted his wrist and grabbed his sword inversely to stab the back of the falling warrior. He could feel a life being cut off followed by a groan from his sword. Hi, hiiik! The warriors of the River of Death hesitated. Their faces were now filled with fear rather than excitement. And Ju Seo Cheon didnt miss that opportunity. He charged towards them and entered their grasp. Uaaagh! Kuak! The sword containing the plum blossom danced in the air. Its execution was perfect, it was as tranquil and serene as it should be yet it delivered a powerful attack. At times, it seemed like a butterfly was fluttering its wings but soon turned into a fierce storm to threaten the warriors of the River of Death. Their heads got separated from their bodies and a hole got pierced in their chests and blood poured down from it. \u2018Is it really his first time in Kang Ho? The second rate warrior of Weng An got thrilled by Ju Seo Cheons strength. He had a face that he couldnt believe what he was seeing. Based on his information, Ju Seo Cheon was only twelve. A kid that was only twelve years old didnt have any hesitation at all in his first battle. It was to the point that he felt a bit of alienation. Come! Ju Seo Cheon shook off the blood in his sword and yelled. I am Ju Seo Cheon, of the Mount Hua sect! Ju Seo Cheon of the Mount Hua Sect! He got goosebumps in all his body and felt thrilled. He had never yelled this confidently in his past life. He only followed others when they yelled. But that wasnt the case now. The warriors were following his back. It didnt matter that they were third rate. They believed in him and were looking at his back. This moment was one that he wouldnt be able to forget. Waaaa! The warriors of the Murim Association cheered. It was the opposite of how they were a while ago. There was a difference in numbers that was twice as large but they had a young expert here. They believed in that. Even if an allied warrior got stabbed in their chests, they didnt feel fear and counterattacked. Theres no need to push yourselves so just do what I told you to! Ju Seo Cheon yelled towards the warriors of the Murim Association. Before the warriors of the River of Death destroyed the gate, he had told them to induce the enemy warriors to his side. Most of them disapproved of his words but now they were following it in earnest. The warriors of the Murim Association basically focused on defense and at the same time sent the warriors towards Ju Seo Cheon. Ju Seo Cheon flew off swiftly when an enemy entered his, even if it was only by a little, and inflicted a blow. Kuaaagh! The thirty warriors that had first entered the gate decreased exponentially. Then, the enemy warriors that were holding in wait in a relaxed manner also entered inside the gates and an additional thirty people arrived. The warriors of the River of Death, that numberd a hundred in the beginning, decreased to fifty. A pile of corpses started to accumulate in front of the gate to the point that it disturbed in entering the gate. The path got blocked for the enemy warriors that were only third rate so it became harder to fight. Ju Seo Cheon roamed freely as if he didnt care about that at all and executed sword dances. Take this! The most annoying thing was Zhuge Seung Kye, who was at the rear. There werent that many bamboo crossbows because he made them in a hurry but it obstructed them every time they wanted to pass over the warriors of the Murim Association. Ju Seo Cheon noticed that like a ghost everytime that happened and swung his sword swiftly to take the lives of the warriors. The battle in this place was at a low level compared to the battle taking place in Kaiyan, that was half a day away from this place, but it was still fine. The members that could enter through the gate were limited, and formed a solid defensive formation to take away the lives of the enemies. Da, damn it! When the situation started to flow in an unexpected way, Mak Won Gap rolled his eyes quickly and looked furtively for a chance to escape. He was afraid of trouble that would occur if he escaped but he didnt see any hope if they continued like this. It seemed like it was the same for the other warriors of the River of Death, that their eyes that were filled with gold at the beginning started to turn and change with fear. Just what in the world are you doing! Mak Won Gaps panicked voice rang in the battlefield. And what are you supposed to be doing? Ju Seo Cheon walked towards Mak Won Gap and everyone trembled at that even though he wasnt particularly aggressive. Hes putting on airs, Im sure of it. Im certain that hes exhausted as he has been fighting until now. Mak Won Gap mumbled to himself as if trying to fall into self hypnosis. That would be right in ordinary cases. Ju Seo Cheon nodded in agreement. But Im not. Im sorry to take away your hopes but my nickname as the flashy yet frail is quite the misconception you see. Ju Seo Cheon smiled brightly without even dropping a drop of sweat. That smile looked like it belonged to the devil for Mak Won Gap. Don, dont get any closer! Mak Won Gap yelled with a scared voice, this fear affected the other enemy warriors. Even if that wasnt the case, they were already scared of Ju Seo Cheon for having killed close to fifty warriors in an instant. Everyone else lost their fighting spirit as the commander and the strongest of them showed fright. Es, escape! Uaaagh! One person escaped and that spread to the others like a disease. Everyone let out scared voices and escaped. Damn it! In the end Mak Won Gap also had to give up. He couldnt do anything about his members that became uncontrollable. He pushed away the warriors of the River of Death with force and tried to escape. Get away! Im getting away first! Mak Won Gaps voice rang in the battlefield. No, you cant leave. He closed the distance with Mak Won Gap as if the corpses spread on the floor didnt obstruct him at all. Mak Won Gap got grabbed by his collar after having only advanced a few meters. Oh my, great master! Im sorry for not having recognized you! Mak Won Gap screamed pitifully as soon as he got grabbed. He dropped his sword to the floor as if he didnt even want to resist. \u2018I dont know how this happened but this kid is a kid I cant do anything against. I have to find a way to live. He had completely lost his will to fight after seeing how Ju Seo Cheon fought. He was an opponent he couldnt defeat at all. His judgement was as fast as lightning as he became certain of it. Mak Won Gap threw away his pride and lowered his pride to continue living. You have to keep on living so I can hear the details from you, so you will need to stay here. I dont know much, great master. Its more comfortable if you leave me be. Things like thi\u2026 Really? I should kill you then. I will answer whatever you want! Starting from this moment, I am going to follow great master!","title":"volcanic-26"},{"location":"volcanic-26/#vocanic-age-chapter-26","text":"Editor: Imagine Zhuge Seung Kye had hidden himself as soon as he heard news that the River of Death was attacking them. Due to this People thought that he had gotten scared and hid himself. But that wasnt the case at all. It was the opposite. Rather than hiding, Zhuge Seung Kye gathered objects like arrows and bamboo barrels to make an assassination weapon. An, an assassination weapon? Mak Won Gap got bewildered. \u2018The Sichuan Family? It was a weapon he had never seen or heard of before. The only people that would use that kind of assassination weapon were the ones that belonged to the Sichuan Family. Haha, its a success! A success! Zhuge Seung Kye jumped in joy and cheered. Well done Zhuge Seung Kye! Ju Seo Cheon called out Zhuge Seung Kyes name out loud on purpose. It was so that everyone in the surroundings was able to hear him. The Zhuge family? Mak Won Gap asked back with a surprised face. No, why would the Zhuge Sega use assassination weapons? The Righteous Faction considered that using assassination tools was a disgrace, except for the Sichuan Family. Even if it wasnt practicing it and helping others use it, the four factions penalized it greatly. Huk! Th, they saw me! Zhuge Seung Kye stopped jumping in joy and got bewildered. This was the first time he had gotten so much attention that he felt his hands tremble and his heart sink. Cold sweat dripped from his forehead and his mind turned white. Wh, what are you looking at! I also know that im useless! His negative way of thinking had returned. Zhuge Seung Kye embraced the bamboo crossbow and got teary. It was a hard situation for a kid that was only ten. In addition, he hadnt trained in martial arts properly so he wasnt able to hold it when the warriors of the River of Death looked at him menacingly. For the Zhuge Sega to use assassination weapons, how cowardly! You should be ashamed! Mak Won Gaps eyes turned red and yelled. Hah. The second rate warrior of Weng An looked at Mak Won Gap dumbfoundedly and the third rate warriors also showed similar reactions to him. The River of Death was a group that didnt care about honor if it meant winning. But Mak Won Gap didnt care about their gazes and continued to criticize Zhuge Seung Kye. Dont fight like that from up there and lets have a fair square fight! \u2018Thats dangerous. Mak Won Gap got cautious of the bamboo crossbow. The warriors that got fired a while ago werent life threatening but it was still troublesome. He didnt have the leisure to mind those arrows. If he did, he would have been killed by Ju Seo Cheon. \u2018In addition, martial artists of the Righteous Faction would give up their heads by their own if you tell them its cowardly. Theres no way he wont fall for it. Mak Won Gap was sure of it. Wasnt it you who came to attack a small group with a big one? Now youre pointing out what is right and wrong. Have some shame. Ju Seo Cheon stepped forward as if that wouldnt work and smirked. Seung Kye, it has become certain with this. You are clearly a genius. Thats why you should serve me as your older brother. You are spouting nonsense again. Zhuge Seung Kye put on a tired expression. Attack! Mak Won Gaps voice rang resonantly. A third rate warrior holding a sword charged towards him. He had quite a confident expression but he was so slow it made Ju Seo Cheon yawn. Die! The third rate warrior yelled energetically and swung his sword. Ju Seo Cheon took a step to his left and dodged it lightly. \u2018Plum Blossom Brilliant Sword Art! Ju Seo Cheons blade moved so fast that to the average warrior it had simply disappeared. Huk! The third rate warrior stared at the sword with a surprised look but it was too late. Great pain was felt in his solar plexus and blood poured out. This brat! This time two warriors attacked him from both sides. Ju Seo Cheon held his sword more tightly and got satisfied. \u2018I have been training constantly so I was worried if I wasnt able to use it in real combat, so Im glad that isnt the case. He had succeeded in the Fourteen Stances of the Plum Blossom Sword and the Plum Blossom Brilliant Sword Art without much problems. This time, Ju Seo Cheon took a defensive posture and executed the Five Elements Plum Blossom Sword Art. The Five Elements Plum Blossom Sword Art, that contained the five elements, was a martial art that circulated defensive and offensive attacks naturally. It was a sword technique that immediately let you attack after having defended. The sharp sound of wind being split was heard from both sides and swords came flying towards him. However, Ju Seo Cheon lightly fended them off. Ugh! A third rate warrior couldnt hold his weight and fell to his right and the other third rate warrior that was attacking from the right got bewildered. One. He swung his sword horizontally and cleanly cut off the heads of the warriors that were at his right. Ju Seo Cheon twisted his wrist and grabbed his sword inversely to stab the back of the falling warrior. He could feel a life being cut off followed by a groan from his sword. Hi, hiiik! The warriors of the River of Death hesitated. Their faces were now filled with fear rather than excitement. And Ju Seo Cheon didnt miss that opportunity. He charged towards them and entered their grasp. Uaaagh! Kuak! The sword containing the plum blossom danced in the air. Its execution was perfect, it was as tranquil and serene as it should be yet it delivered a powerful attack. At times, it seemed like a butterfly was fluttering its wings but soon turned into a fierce storm to threaten the warriors of the River of Death. Their heads got separated from their bodies and a hole got pierced in their chests and blood poured down from it. \u2018Is it really his first time in Kang Ho? The second rate warrior of Weng An got thrilled by Ju Seo Cheons strength. He had a face that he couldnt believe what he was seeing. Based on his information, Ju Seo Cheon was only twelve. A kid that was only twelve years old didnt have any hesitation at all in his first battle. It was to the point that he felt a bit of alienation. Come! Ju Seo Cheon shook off the blood in his sword and yelled. I am Ju Seo Cheon, of the Mount Hua sect! Ju Seo Cheon of the Mount Hua Sect! He got goosebumps in all his body and felt thrilled. He had never yelled this confidently in his past life. He only followed others when they yelled. But that wasnt the case now. The warriors were following his back. It didnt matter that they were third rate. They believed in him and were looking at his back. This moment was one that he wouldnt be able to forget. Waaaa! The warriors of the Murim Association cheered. It was the opposite of how they were a while ago. There was a difference in numbers that was twice as large but they had a young expert here. They believed in that. Even if an allied warrior got stabbed in their chests, they didnt feel fear and counterattacked. Theres no need to push yourselves so just do what I told you to! Ju Seo Cheon yelled towards the warriors of the Murim Association. Before the warriors of the River of Death destroyed the gate, he had told them to induce the enemy warriors to his side. Most of them disapproved of his words but now they were following it in earnest. The warriors of the Murim Association basically focused on defense and at the same time sent the warriors towards Ju Seo Cheon. Ju Seo Cheon flew off swiftly when an enemy entered his, even if it was only by a little, and inflicted a blow. Kuaaagh! The thirty warriors that had first entered the gate decreased exponentially.

The help of the Fourteenth Gallant Sword was especially big. The prestige of Gu Pung spread in Kang Ho not long after. With the help of reinforcements they had attained victory successfully and returned to Weng An. Each one of them couldnt hold their surprise when they arrived at the place. Wh, what is\u2026 They imagined people could receive them in the gates when the notices of their victory spread. But rather than receiving them, there were traces of blood in the destroyed gates. No! Gu Pung looked for Ju Seo Cheon as soon as he arrived. His complexion looked pale for the first time since he came down from Mount Hua. But that lasted for only a moment. He let out a sigh of relief when he saw Ju Seo Cheon coming out and greeting him. What happened? Gu Pung asked Ju Seo Cheon. I will explain. The only second rate warrior of Weng An started to explain. All the important figures like Gu Pung, Zhuge Sak, etc. tilted their heads at the words of the second rate warrior. And as soon as he finished speaking, people showed disbelief rather than surprise. Zhuge Sak especially like that. Even if the enemy was all third rate, you successfully subjugated with only a hundred of you? It wasnt weird to not believe in those words. All the warriors that had left behind in Weng An were third rates, except for one person. Even if they used a formation utilizing the gates, it was impossible to defeat a force that had fifty times more numbers. It was all thanks to young master Ju. No, great master Ju. The second rate warrior added. Zhuge Sak glanced at the warrior and then became angry. You! Wont you speak properly! Everyone here knows that he is only twelve, who are you trying to take for a fool! The warrior flinched at Zhuge Saks shouting. Tw, twelve? The only figure that didnt know about the kid, Mak Won Gap, raised his head while he was tied down with ropes. It, its the truth! Thats right great master. We saw it clearly with our eyes. The other warriors took courage and stepped in. \u2018We have to repay the grace we received from great master Ju. His nickname had changed into great master in no time. It was a battle that they thought nobody would be able to survive. Everyone was ready to lose their lives. A despairing situation that had no hope at all got completely overturned with Ju Seo Cheon appearing. No one had died, and even though some suffered minor injuries, none of them took any substantial injuries. The warriors that received Ju Seo Cheons help protected him from the gratefulness that surged from deep within. Zhuge Sak lowered his voice and mumbled as it wasnt only one or two people defending him, but all the warriors in Weng An. Hm, indeed. You said that there were only third rate warriors in the River of Death and in addition you didnt annihilate them but half of them got scared and fled in fright. If its that, its understandable. Thats nothing impressive. Zhuge Sak put an uninterested expression in no time. Yes. And dont I have more internal energy than other kids my age? That was of great help. Ju Seo Cheon added some words to evade needless suspicion. Great master\u2026 The warriors of Weng An put on unsatisfactory expressions as the evaluation of their benefactor decreased . \u2018Its not time to appear yet. He had called out his name in the battle but that was because he could plentily take care of the after effects. It was a battle between third rate anyways. Even if he attained complete victory, he wouldnt receive any great evaluations because of the low level of the fight. Ju Seo Cheon expected that and ran wild. But you are still impressive. You have done well. Gu Pung complimented Ju Seo Cheon with a proud face. \u2018I have seen him since long ago but his insight and calmness isnt normal at all. Although his martial arts is average. Everyone at that age would get stiff at their first battle but he didnt get bewildered at all and fought calmly while leading the warriors. Gu Pung thought inwardly. Ju Seo Cheon had hidden his abilities well and nothing about his real power got revealed because of this situation. However, Gu Pung placed focus on Ju Seo Cheons ability to command or his composure and not his martial arts as he hadnt known the extent of them. \u2018He will become a great leading figure. A smile spread in Gu Pungs face. Four days later. The group returned after the battle of Weng An and Kaiyan. News about the battle spread instantly. However, only news about the battle of Kaiyan spread because it was of a bigger scale than the battle in Weng An. It wasnt that it didnt get mentioned at all, it got buried by the others. Hahaha! The laughter of Shin Do Gyun resonated. Today, a great feast opened up in Kaiyan. It was a feast celebrating their complete victory. They almost suffered great losses in the forces they dispatched in Kaiyan and almost got their territory taken by the enemy. But fortunately, they came out victorious without much damage thanks to the reinforcements of the Fourteenth Gallant Sword and to top it off Three Headed Mad Dog had also died. The corners of his lips curved until it reached his ears. Im saying this one more time, but you have really done a good job. I was so happy when I heard the news that I didnt think of my face and danced in the streets. Theres plenty of food and alcohol so enjoy! There were no geishas as Jang Seo Eun and Zhuge Suran were alo attending. Instead, women attendants poured them alcohol or served food. Wow, young brother. Im seeing you in a new light! Jang Hong laughed magnanimously and patted Ju Seo Cheons back. Its nothing compared to you, fellow brothers. Ju Seo Cheon lowered himself and praised Jang Hong. Jang Hong and Jang Seo Eun had shown good skills for it to be their first real battle. They didnt get greatly injured because they were protected by the guards that departed with them from Kae An and could accumulate experience safely. No need to be modest brother. It seems like we underestimated your skills. Jang Seo Eun also complemented Ju Seo Cheon sincerely. But the results may have been different if Jang Hong and Jang Seo Eun didnt stand out and only Ju Seo Cheons performance was spread. Thank you. Ju Seo Cheon also replied formally today. Zhuge Sang and Zhuge Suran approached him and congratulated him. You are really great young master Ju. Congratulations. Curiosity appeared in the eyes of Zhuge Sang and he could feel uninterest from Zhuge Suran. No, hyung-nim. Theres no need to speak so uncomfortably. Isnt that right fellow brother? Jang Hong asked Ju Seo Cheon. Yes, of course. Treat me comfortably. Ju Seo Cheon got happy at that. \u2018It wont be bad to form a connection with the siblings in advance. It will certainly be of great help. Jang Hong was quite bothersome because he spoke too much but at least for now, he was feeling grateful towards his sociability. Zhuge Seung Kye was certainly the one he had to care about the most but it didnt mean that he wouldnt socialize with these two. Thank you. I will be in your care. Zhuge Sang showed his white teeth and saluted. Ju Seo Cheon got along with the Zhuge siblings and the siblings of the Lotus Peak and conversed with them. And when they were starting to get drunk with alcohol, he snuck out and approached Zhuge Seung Kye was sitting alone in a corner. What is it? Zhuge Seung Kye faced Ju Seo Cheon with a taciturn face. In addition, Zhuge Seung Kyes performance wasnt spread. He also thought that using assassination weapons was a disgrace and requested to keep this a secret as it wasnt something to be proud of. Ju Seo Cheon wanted to increase Zhuge Seung Kyes confidence with this opportunity but it would get bothersome in several ways if it got known that he made an assassination weapon. Honestly speaking, we wouldnt have been able to win in the battle if it wasnt for my genius younger brother. If you hadnt been there, I wouldnt have been able to stay alive. Ju Seo Cheon sat next to Zhuge Seung Kye. Its really regretful that we can only keep this as a secret but dont think too bad about it. I will recognize you even when the world refuses to. Ju Seo Cheons tongue moved swiftly and complimented him. It was incomparable from the fellow brothers of the Lotus Peak. Ahem, ahem. It seemed like Zhuge Seung Kye didnt feel that bad about it that he flushed and coughed. He was certainly a genius but he was still a ten year old kid. He was simpler than he thought. I thank you for your compliments but in my position the amazing one isnt me but you\u2026 Zhuge Seung Kye had thought of Ju Seo Cheon as being a special person with some abilities. He knew that members of the Lotus Peak were outstanding but people tend not to believe in things if they dont see it with their own eyes. But his perception changed in Weng An. Zhuge Seung Kye was able to realize just how great Ju Seo Cheon was. \u2018He is that amazing but gets scorned at saying that hes the flashy yet frail one, just how amazing are the swordsmen of Mount Hua? Zhuge Seung Kye made a misunderstanding. Even a great senior disciple of the Lotus Peak wouldnt be able to imitate the swordsmanship he had shown. Zhuge Seung Kye had no eye for that so he misunderstood on his own. Haha,you already realized the greatness of this older brother of yours. But theres no need to feel so envious. I was just lucky and consumed a miraculous medicine. You will also be able to become like me if you consume one. Ju Seo Cheon was opening his eyes sharply. His eyes were shining as if they had discovered something. A miraculous medicine? Right. No matter how hard it is to understand martial arts, you will be able to solve all of it if you have a miraculous medicine. You will also be able to become an expert in an instant! Ju Seo Cheon lied without even licking his lips. I dont think thats true\u2026 Zhuge Seung Kye mumbled with suspicious eyes. Seung Kye, are you more of an expert than me? Thats not the case but\u2026 Have you consumed a miraculous medicine before? Thats not the case either but\u2026 If you havent, dont speak Seung Kye felt like he was being tricked. Do you think that experiencing that luck at that scale is easy in the first place? If that was the case, Murim would be filled with experts everywhere! Zhuge Seung Kye raised his voice as if telling him not to spout nonsense but the only one that heard his voice was Ju Seo Cheon because of the noisy feast. Really? What will you do if this brother of yours gets you a miraculous medicine? Coincidentally, I happen to have some information regarding said medicines. A thick smile spread on Ju Seo Cheons face. Smirk. Zhuge Seung Kye laughed out loud. If that is true I will of course become your younger brother and will even become your underling. Although that will never happen. That promise, I hope you keep it. Ju Seo Cheons mouth curved like a crescent moon.","title":"volcanic-27"},{"location":"volcanic-27/#vocanic-age-chapter-27","text":"Editor: Imagine The Murim Association was about to get defeated in Kaiyan and get Weng An taken but they managed to get out victories with the help of reinforcements.

In addition, Zhuge Seung Kyes performance wasnt spread. He also thought that using assassination weapons was a disgrace and requested to keep this a secret as it wasnt something to be proud of. Ju Seo Cheon wanted to increase Zhuge Seung Kyes confidence with this opportunity but it would get bothersome in several ways if it got known that he made an assassination weapon. Honestly speaking, we wouldnt have been able to win in the battle if it wasnt for my genius younger brother. If you hadnt been there, I wouldnt have been able to stay alive. Ju Seo Cheon sat next to Zhuge Seung Kye. Its really regretful that we can only keep this as a secret but dont think too bad about it. I will recognize you even when the world refuses to. Ju Seo Cheons tongue moved swiftly and complimented him. It was incomparable from the fellow brothers of the Lotus Peak. Ahem, ahem. It seemed like Zhuge Seung Kye didnt feel that bad about it that he flushed and coughed. He was certainly a genius but he was still a ten year old kid. He was simpler than he thought. I thank you for your compliments but in my position the amazing one isnt me but you\u2026 Zhuge Seung Kye had thought of Ju Seo Cheon as being a special person with some abilities. He knew that members of the Lotus Peak were outstanding but people tend not to believe in things if they dont see it with their own eyes. But his perception changed in Weng An. Zhuge Seung Kye was able to realize just how great Ju Seo Cheon was. \u2018He is that amazing but gets scorned at saying that hes the flashy yet frail one, just how amazing are the swordsmen of Mount Hua? Zhuge Seung Kye made a misunderstanding. Even a great senior disciple of the Lotus Peak wouldnt be able to imitate the swordsmanship he had shown. Zhuge Seung Kye had no eye for that so he misunderstood on his own. Haha,you already realized the greatness of this older brother of yours. But theres no need to feel so envious. I was just lucky and consumed a miraculous medicine. You will also be able to become like me if you consume one. Ju Seo Cheon was opening his eyes sharply. His eyes were shining as if they had discovered something. A miraculous medicine? Right. No matter how hard it is to understand martial arts, you will be able to solve all of it if you have a miraculous medicine. You will also be able to become an expert in an instant! Ju Seo Cheon lied without even licking his lips. I dont think thats true\u2026 Zhuge Seung Kye mumbled with suspicious eyes. Seung Kye, are you more of an expert than me? Thats not the case but\u2026 Have you consumed a miraculous medicine before? Thats not the case either but\u2026 If you havent, dont speak Seung Kye felt like he was being tricked. Do you think that experiencing that luck at that scale is easy in the first place? If that was the case, Murim would be filled with experts everywhere! Zhuge Seung Kye raised his voice as if telling him not to spout nonsense but the only one that heard his voice was Ju Seo Cheon because of the noisy feast. Really? What will you do if this brother of yours gets you a miraculous medicine? Coincidentally, I happen to have some information regarding said medicines. A thick smile spread on Ju Seo Cheons face. Smirk. Zhuge Seung Kye laughed out loud. If that is true I will of course become your younger brother and will even become your underling. Although that will never happen. That promise, I hope you keep it. Ju Seo Cheons mouth curved like a crescent moon.","title":"Vocanic Age Chapter 27"},{"location":"volcanic-28/","text":"Vocanic Age Chapter 28 Editor: Imagine The feast didnt end in one day and continued for two days straight. The first day was solely for the warriors. They prohibited receiving any visits so people from the outside so nobody could bother them. And the second day was filled with merchants or visitors. State your reason for visiting. To congratulate them on their complete victory. I came to give a gift to the Fourteenth Gallant Sword. It wasnt easy to meet a pinnacle expert. People affiliated with great sects like Mount Hua were especially hard to meet. For them to make them remember even their names was the greatest profit. Also, if the Zhuge Sega or the members of the Lotus Peak were lucky they would also be able to form a connection beforehand. It wasnt known when that would be but it would certainly be of help later. People aimed for that and brought gifts that would make it a little bit easier to remember them. Some brought extremely beautiful children. If they were able to get married to the Zhuge Sega family they could aim for an increase in their status. It was a bit vague for Mount Hua sect but it didnt mean that there were no probabilities. They had children except for people with important positions. However, they werent able to transmit the same martial arts as formal disciples, no matter how good their talent was. That was the limit for outer disciples. Although Mount Hua sec was more well dispositioned towards outer disciples than the Shaman Faction, it didnt mean that they werent strict at all. There were various restrictions for them. Whatever the case, it didnt mean that there were no weddings at all because of these restrictions. People worked hard to attract their attention and to not miss that opportunity. Today, I will teach you how to treat people. Gu Pung gathered the members of the Lotus Peak and said. It would be serious if a disciple of Mount Hua they raised with all their heart and soul got blinded by wealth. Falling in love was not something the sect controlled but what would children know about love? Falling for their obvious ploy when they werent mature enough was a problem. Because of this, Gu Pung faced dozens of people in a day even though it was bothersome for him. The disciples of the Lotus Peak didnt say anything while standing behind Gu Pung and merely introduced themselves. Its better to reject a gift if they make a request or something similar. Also, greed is prohibited for a taoist. You should only receive it if it is sincere. In the case of a gift that is excessive it means they expect something, an indication you can use to check would when looking at you, their eyes will dilate. We understand. Also, try to evade them if there is even a little bit of a promising tone in their words. Promises are as heavy as favor and dangerous for martial artists of the Righteous Faction like ourselves. We will take it into account. Jang Hong and Jang Seo Eun focused on Gu Pungs words and bore them in their minds and Ju Seo Cheon only pretended to listen. He was originally an Elder of Mount Hua. He was really accustomed to handling people. In his past life, he was more accustomed to conversing rather than fighting others. \u2018Hm, senior uncle is certainly a great person. His martial arts were one thing but his attitude on treating people was also at the pinnacle. He was extremely eloquent when addressing people and seemed as if it were second nature. Dozens upon dozens of compliments poured down in a day. Jang Hong and Jang Seo Eun seemed to be quite proud in the beginning but they started to get tired as that repeated several times. Among the visitors, there were also small and middle sized sects belonging to the Righteous Faction besides merchants. The lords of those sects even brought their children and introduced them to the group. \u2018Where are you. On the other hand Ju Seo Cheon was only searching for a person when Jang Seo Eun and Jang Hong and even Gu Pung was getting tired. He ignored most of the lords of the small and big sects. He roughly listened to their names and then took a rest after emptying his head. But he seemed to perk his ears when merchants came and focused. \u2018He is certainly here. \u2018The Merchant King, Lee Ui Chae! He shouted his name in his head. The merchant king was certainly in Guizhou at this time. It was to find a sponsor because he was a merchant that lacked funds. This was also the reason he had come to the dangerous Guizhou without having proper protection. Many members of Murim that could become a sponsor came to this place, risking their lives with how dangerous it was here. If he could at least grab one of them, an opportunity to release his potential would come. \u2018Damn it. I also prepared to help you. So please appear in front of me. The sun that was at its peak had started to fall. Visitors would stop coming soon. There were many people waiting but the number of people they could meet was limited. He couldnt even sneak out at night and go find the visitors by himself. Even if that wasnt the case, Gu Pung was taking more care of Ju Seo Cheon because he thought that he could have lost Ju Seo Cheon at Weng An. \u2018He wouldnt have gone to the Zhuge Sega, right? The Zhuge Sega had also performed great at the battle in Kae An but they were lacking compared to Gu Pung. He had thought that the merchant king would certainly come here as someone that thoroughly differentiated from benefits. He was almost certain of it. But what was happening? He couldnt see Lee Ui Chae and not even anyone with a similar name. Ju Seo Cheons insides started to burn the more time passed. Hehehe, how are you? We meet again like this. A familiar man visited them when the sun had almost set down. He bowed down excessively and his eyes looked somewhat servile. It was to the point that it looked burdensome. \u2018Was he the small merchant? That one isnt it. It was the barker they saw at Kae Ang, the one that was so servile it was excessive. Ju Seo Cheon guessed that the merchant king may have changed his name and he started to think of the characteristics of the merchant king he had heard in his past life in preparation for that. They said that the merchant king was as fat as his greed or obsession towards wealth. And also, his spirit was so high it could pierce the sky that he didnt lower himself even in front of the leader of Murim. He got criticized in Murim saying that he was arrogant and cocky for a mere merchant. At least, this small merchant that bowed so low it was servile and had a small physique wasnt the merchant king. Ju Seo Cheons interest disappeared and thought of another thing. \u2018Now that it has turned like this, I should check the visitors list later. He was sure that he had gone to the Zhuge Sega if he hadnt come to this place. But if that wasnt the case either, it would become really troublesome. Now that it had turned out like this, he wished for the visits to finish faster. You are indeed the disciples of the great Mount Hua. I was struck with admiration when I heard the news not long ago. The small merchant only spoke flattery. They were words praising Gu Pung or Mount Hua but it was so blatant and obvious that it was rather more tiresome. Hey, merchant. Im sorry but cant we finish here? I spoke with a lot of people today so I hope you understand. In the end even Gu Pung wasnt able to endure it and interrupted the words of the merchant. Do, dont be like that. Cant you give me some of your time? And then, the merchant got clearly flustered. It seemed like he was saying \u2018I have prepared a lot so I cant return like this. Desperation was shown in his eyes. Im sorry. You can return now. Gu Pung gave a clear farewell. The warriors that were in wait near the entrance moved. Please wait a moment! I have an outstanding business plan. Just give me five minutes, no even half that time is fine so just listen to me! You wont regret it! Cant you just punish people like him? Gu Pung was feeling tired of him so there was no way Jang Hong wasnt. He put a really annoyed expression. Come here! You crazy bastard, think of my position too! There were also levels among the visitors. Their turn to visit would change depending on their prestige. If their turn ended, it meant that that had nothing much in them. The warriors also knew that fact so they dragged away the merchant with no hesitation. Let me go, you bastards! Do you know who I am! I am a merchant of the Kae An branch of the Murim Association! Tch. The warriors clicked their tongues and dragged away the merchant. The Golden Merchant Organization! Flinch. Ju Seo Cheon stopped in place while following Gu Pungs back. He could see the backs of Jang Hong, Jang Seo Eun and Gu Pung getting farther away. \u2018Dont tell me. The world flowed slowly and he concentrated internal energy in his hearing. The words echoed in his head. Ju Seo Cheon erased all thoughts about the visitor records and slowly turned back. Eyes that swirled with greed and desperation. Eyes that others would click their tongues when they saw it. He didnt know why he was seeing the eyes of the merchant in gold. This small merchant is the owner of a small organization called the Golden Merchant Organization. My name is Lee Ui Chae\u2026 And his voice got smaller. Ju Seo Cheon saw him being dragged away and laughed out loud. They say that Its always in the last place you look. Who would have imagined that I would meet you like this\u2026 Being fat meant one was at the tip of prosperity. You become fatter as you had more things and great merchants were especially like that. But the current Lee Ui Chae was rather lacking than. He was looking for a sponsor so there was no way he would spend excessively. It wasnt to the point that he starved but he didnt over eat either. He didnt have that much fat nor excessive amounts either. There was also a circumstance for his personality. When he got to know about the merchant king in his past life, Lee Ui Chae had already become someone he couldnt touch. Even if Lee Ui Chae was so servile to the point he got disdained, people wouldnt be able to take care of the aftermaths if they went around saying that. It wasnt weird that it got buried as a secret. More than anything, his memories about Lee Ui Chae belonged to about sixty years ago in his past life. It would be weirder if the past got transmitted like it was. \u2018I made a mistake. People that survived at the age of war like Lee Ui Chae and people that came out victorious had high possibilities of having their past reformed. But he wasnt able to think of that. There was information he didnt know about even after having become an Elder. Ju Seo Cheon reflected on himself for having relied too much on the information of the future. The second day. The meetings ended. Lee Ui Chae visited Gu Pung again but obviously didnt meet with him again. The visiting period had already ended. He had pledged several times in an hospitable way but he couldnt help but return as the warriors of the Murim Association gave him a warning. But\u2026 Hello, mister merchant.

Lee Ui Chae met a figure he would have never thought about. This novel is being translated by Centinni","title":"Vocanic Age Chapter 28"},{"location":"volcanic-29/","text":"Vocanic Age Chapter 29 Editor: Imagine Ju, Ju Seo Cheon? Lee Ui Che got so surprised he mumbled the name unconsciously. And then realized that he had made a mistake. Im sorry young master Ju. I was so surprised I made a mistake. The title of young master came out naturally and no awkwardness could be felt in it. Im sorry but what business did you have with me? Did the Fourteenth Gallant Sword\u2026? Expectation arose in Lee Ui Chaes eyes. Thats not the case. Ju Seo Cheon shook his head without hesitating. Is that so\u2026 Lee Ui Chae showed a disappointed look blatantly. His eyes were now showing despair instead of expectation. But I do have some business with you. Ju Seo Cheon rubbed his thumb, index and middle finger and smirked. Just what\u2026? Lee Ui Chae put on a confused face and tilted his head. Why dont we change places first? Ah, I understand. \u2018Theres something! Lee Ui Chae realized instinctively that the business Ju Seo Cheon had with him wasnt normal. A smell pierced his nose. \u2018The smell of money! His sense of smell and all the other senses of his body were telling him that. It made him think that the opportunity he had been waiting for had finally come. In his eyes, no, objectively speaking Ju Seo Cheon wasnt a normal kid at all. Being a member of the Lotus Peak was already outside the range of being normal but he thought that Ju Seo Cheon was even more special than that. Based on his information, Ju Seo Cheon was merely twelve. Looking like a fifteen year old kid was a different thing but the mature aura that was released from his mind and body and even his qi werent normal. his qi didnt match a twelve year old kid at all. it was closer to that of a middle aged man or an old man. You could see dignity even from his steps and the gaze and confidence he gave out when walking wasnt normal at all. \u2018He wasnt like this when I last saw him. Its not that I missed it. He was hiding it. The future merchant king indeed. He was really fast on catching on things. Lee Ui Chae realized that something was out of place and prepared a separate place for them. Lets leave behind useless introductions and head straight to the main point. Thats why you should also stop from speaking obvious words. Ju Seo Cheon spoke as soon as he sat down. Ah, ahem. You can speak comfortably. It seemed like Lee Ui Chae liked Ju Seo Cheons polite attitude that he was looking at him with goodwill. Most martial artists were arrogant even though they were young and that was because of their high pride. Disciples of great sects were especially prone to this. Lee Ui Chae had been ignored by various martial artists so Ju Seo Cheons actions were quite touching in his position. Its fine. Isnt business something about trust and manners? That much should be obvious. Ju Seo Cheon smiled inwardly. The situation was flowing as he expected. Lee Ui Chae, who would be called the merchant king one day, wasnt his underling at all. That was the same for his second life. The merchant king was someone that had done business with the Righteous Faction, Death Faction, and even the Second Generation of The Demonic Path. His talent was the real deal. It would be better to keep an equal relationship rather than having a superior and inferior relationship to receive his help in the future. A superior and an inferior relationship could damage their relationship so the risks it bore was great. But, when you say main point\u2026 The business you proposed to my senior uncle. Im interested in that. Lee Ui Chaes eyes had widened at Ju Seo Cheons words. It seemed like he wasnt expecting that at all. Is that true? Yes. Hm\u2026 Lee Ui Chae touched his beard that he had just started to trim. It seemed like he was pondering. Ju Seo Cheon got satisfied with Lee Ui Chaes reaction inwardly. \u2018Good. I realized that he isnt a simple fool with this. I was a bit uneasy\u2026but im glad. Not doubting this situation would be weirder. Honestly speaking, even I know that Im no one great so I cant understand on what basis you decided to talk to me. It also seems like you came here in secret from the Fourteenth Gallant Sword and the other members of the Lotus Peak\u2026 Lee Ui Chae thought that Ju Seo Cheon wanted to make fun of him or use him in some kind of conspiracy. But of course, one would wonder what a twelve year old kid could do. Perhaps the Zhuge Sega may be behind him as they liked to plan schemes behind the back of others. But of course, a small merchant such as himself had to think about what benefits it would bring the Zhuge Sega for them to choose to work with a nobody like himself. Its because I also have something to propose to you. Propose? Yes. But before that I want to hear about your business. Is that okay? Of course. Although it was dubious, it didnt mean that he really suspected him. Actually, I just said that it was a business to attract attention but it isnt anything great. Ju Seo Cheon waited for Lee Ui Chae \u2018s next words. Lee Ui Chae looked at Ju Seo Cheons eyes and let out a sigh of relief after seeing that his face hadnt stiffened. Our Golden Merchant Organization handles mostly rice. Its a product you can see anywhere but I am planning on selling this rice as provisions to armies. \u2018Certainly. It was like he had expected. At least, the trigger that had spread Lee Ui Chaes name wasnt a lie. To sum it up, you need an opportunity to become a war merchant. Ho, thats right. Lee Ui Chae nodded in admiration. \u2018I wonder how that brain of his functions? He was a martial artist that was distances away from the business world. Being a figure of an important post was a different matter but he was a kid that wasnt even an adult yet. So he couldnt help but feel surprised as he guessed what he was thinking. But of course, that was something Ju Seo Cheon already knew but there was no way Lee Ui Chae knew about that. So what you need is financial support. I would be grateful if that was the case, I would excuse myself\u2026 Lee Ui Chae checked on Ju Seo Cheon. Yes, unfortunately it will be difficult on the financial part. How much money would a kid even have? Ju Seo Cheon smiled bitterly. No, its fine. Lee Ui Chae gulped saliva and answered. There was a bit of regret lingering in his face but it also showed that it didnt matter. There are also many other parts in which you can support me besides financial matters. Tell me about them. \u2026This subject can be a bit\u2026 sensitive. So I hope the young master can listen until the end. Lee Ui Chae looked clearly nervous. He drank some water from the cup that was on the table and opened his mouth. If I speak in a direct manner, I need connections. I dont care where it is but I hope you can entrust me with the trading rights of provisions for an army. The amount I have isnt huge but I can prepare provisions for a war middling in scale These were obvious words but there was no way that the Murim Association or the Righteous Faction would farm. Even if they did, it was only the amount for them to eat. Thats why if they wanted to obtain provisions, they had to buy them from merchants. Most of them traded through outer disciples or people related by blood to formal disciples. The amount and the money being traded wasnt low at all so it couldnt be entrusted to just anyone. They needed an introduction. And\u2026 Lee Ui Chae showed to be really cautious. He glanced at Ju Seo Cheons face several times. It seemed like he wanted to say something but he kept opening and closing his mouth as if he couldnt say it out loud. Ju Seo Cheon knew fully well why he was acting like that but he pretended to not know anything and said. I wont get angry so just tell me. I promise I will make a judgement after listening to everything. Lee Ui Chae also regained courage at those words. \u2026Young master should have participated in the major meetings where the Fourteenth Gallant Sword and the branch manager of Kaiyang participated in, am I right? Yes. Then, I believe you also know about the war regions of Guizhou. Thats why I was saying\u2026can you tell me about isolated places or places that have difficulty in receiving provisions? Lee Ui Chae finished speaking and closed his eyes. It was because he was scared of how Ju Seo Cheon would act. The problem this posed was something a twelve year old kid, no not even a 17 year old kid, could know. Lee Ui Chae was requesting information that was classified to be secret and his intentions were clear. It was because finding places that have problems in receiving provisions and receiving rice to them would make him more money. \u2018Ha, his greed is no joke just like what I heard about him. Moreover, the one that originally helped the merchant king wasnt normal either. Based on the rumors, Lee Ui Chae found places that needed provisions like a ghost and earned money by selling them rice at an expensive price. It could happen one or two times but that couldnt happen every time. It meant that he had an informant behind him. Meaning he had done so through illegitimate means. \u2018No, in the first place the merchant king isnt someone that differentiated between good and evil. Why else would the name of his group have the name gold in it? The one thing they believe in is money. I already expected this much. Money and greed were his sole driving force. He didnt have the beliefs of the Righteous or Death Factions and didnt even have the madness of the Second Generation of The Demonic Path. Did it make money or not? He became certain of it with the conversation they just had. I can help you in the case of the former but even if I do make you a connection it is limited to Weng An. The Weng An branch had been indebted to Ju Seo Cheon and on top of that Ju Seo Cheon belonged to the Lotus Peak. He could take care of that much. It \u2018s fine! Lee Ui Chaes face got dyed with joy. He looked really excited. Weng An was the front line even in Guizhou and supply distribution was that frequent. It was the best region that could make him money. But there is nothing to say about the latter. I will decline. I believe you already know about the reason for that. Even if he needed the being called the merchant king, there were still some limits. If it got known that he spread information he wouldnt be safe even if he was a member of the Lotus Peak. The risk factors were too great. He declined without even a hint of hesitation. Im already grateful that you listened to what I had to say. Honestly speaking, its still marvelous that the head of this humble one is still in place. Lee Ui Chaes face was filled with cold sweat. If you know that it will be better to take care of your future no matter how much of a hurry you are in. Honestly speaking I let this slide precisely because it was me. If it was any other person they may have swung their sword without hesitation. Ju Seo Cheon warned him. It was because the words Lee Ui Chae had said could have killed him as soon as he spoke. I also got courage precisely because it was you. Even if I look like this I do know how to see people. Your heart is as broad as the Yangtze river so I thought that at least I wouldnt die here. As expected of the great master. Lee Ui Chae smiled awkwardly and flattered him. He became more servile when he thought that his head could have flown off. Okay, I will now tell you my story. Yes, please speak. Do you know about the treasury of the Three Eyed Immoral God?","title":"volcanic-29"},{"location":"volcanic-29/#vocanic-age-chapter-29","text":"Editor: Imagine Ju, Ju Seo Cheon? Lee Ui Che got so surprised he mumbled the name unconsciously. And then realized that he had made a mistake. Im sorry young master Ju. I was so surprised I made a mistake. The title of young master came out naturally and no awkwardness could be felt in it. Im sorry but what business did you have with me? Did the Fourteenth Gallant Sword\u2026? Expectation arose in Lee Ui Chaes eyes. Thats not the case. Ju Seo Cheon shook his head without hesitating. Is that so\u2026 Lee Ui Chae showed a disappointed look blatantly. His eyes were now showing despair instead of expectation. But I do have some business with you. Ju Seo Cheon rubbed his thumb, index and middle finger and smirked. Just what\u2026? Lee Ui Chae put on a confused face and tilted his head. Why dont we change places first? Ah, I understand. \u2018Theres something! Lee Ui Chae realized instinctively that the business Ju Seo Cheon had with him wasnt normal. A smell pierced his nose. \u2018The smell of money! His sense of smell and all the other senses of his body were telling him that. It made him think that the opportunity he had been waiting for had finally come. In his eyes, no, objectively speaking Ju Seo Cheon wasnt a normal kid at all. Being a member of the Lotus Peak was already outside the range of being normal but he thought that Ju Seo Cheon was even more special than that. Based on his information, Ju Seo Cheon was merely twelve. Looking like a fifteen year old kid was a different thing but the mature aura that was released from his mind and body and even his qi werent normal. his qi didnt match a twelve year old kid at all. it was closer to that of a middle aged man or an old man. You could see dignity even from his steps and the gaze and confidence he gave out when walking wasnt normal at all. \u2018He wasnt like this when I last saw him. Its not that I missed it. He was hiding it. The future merchant king indeed. He was really fast on catching on things. Lee Ui Chae realized that something was out of place and prepared a separate place for them. Lets leave behind useless introductions and head straight to the main point. Thats why you should also stop from speaking obvious words. Ju Seo Cheon spoke as soon as he sat down. Ah, ahem. You can speak comfortably. It seemed like Lee Ui Chae liked Ju Seo Cheons polite attitude that he was looking at him with goodwill. Most martial artists were arrogant even though they were young and that was because of their high pride. Disciples of great sects were especially prone to this. Lee Ui Chae had been ignored by various martial artists so Ju Seo Cheons actions were quite touching in his position. Its fine. Isnt business something about trust and manners? That much should be obvious. Ju Seo Cheon smiled inwardly. The situation was flowing as he expected. Lee Ui Chae, who would be called the merchant king one day, wasnt his underling at all. That was the same for his second life. The merchant king was someone that had done business with the Righteous Faction, Death Faction, and even the Second Generation of The Demonic Path. His talent was the real deal. It would be better to keep an equal relationship rather than having a superior and inferior relationship to receive his help in the future. A superior and an inferior relationship could damage their relationship so the risks it bore was great. But, when you say main point\u2026 The business you proposed to my senior uncle. Im interested in that. Lee Ui Chaes eyes had widened at Ju Seo Cheons words. It seemed like he wasnt expecting that at all. Is that true? Yes. Hm\u2026 Lee Ui Chae touched his beard that he had just started to trim. It seemed like he was pondering. Ju Seo Cheon got satisfied with Lee Ui Chaes reaction inwardly. \u2018Good. I realized that he isnt a simple fool with this. I was a bit uneasy\u2026but im glad. Not doubting this situation would be weirder. Honestly speaking, even I know that Im no one great so I cant understand on what basis you decided to talk to me. It also seems like you came here in secret from the Fourteenth Gallant Sword and the other members of the Lotus Peak\u2026 Lee Ui Chae thought that Ju Seo Cheon wanted to make fun of him or use him in some kind of conspiracy. But of course, one would wonder what a twelve year old kid could do. Perhaps the Zhuge Sega may be behind him as they liked to plan schemes behind the back of others. But of course, a small merchant such as himself had to think about what benefits it would bring the Zhuge Sega for them to choose to work with a nobody like himself. Its because I also have something to propose to you. Propose? Yes. But before that I want to hear about your business. Is that okay? Of course. Although it was dubious, it didnt mean that he really suspected him. Actually, I just said that it was a business to attract attention but it isnt anything great. Ju Seo Cheon waited for Lee Ui Chae \u2018s next words. Lee Ui Chae looked at Ju Seo Cheons eyes and let out a sigh of relief after seeing that his face hadnt stiffened. Our Golden Merchant Organization handles mostly rice. Its a product you can see anywhere but I am planning on selling this rice as provisions to armies. \u2018Certainly. It was like he had expected. At least, the trigger that had spread Lee Ui Chaes name wasnt a lie. To sum it up, you need an opportunity to become a war merchant. Ho, thats right. Lee Ui Chae nodded in admiration. \u2018I wonder how that brain of his functions? He was a martial artist that was distances away from the business world. Being a figure of an important post was a different matter but he was a kid that wasnt even an adult yet. So he couldnt help but feel surprised as he guessed what he was thinking. But of course, that was something Ju Seo Cheon already knew but there was no way Lee Ui Chae knew about that. So what you need is financial support. I would be grateful if that was the case, I would excuse myself\u2026 Lee Ui Chae checked on Ju Seo Cheon. Yes, unfortunately it will be difficult on the financial part. How much money would a kid even have? Ju Seo Cheon smiled bitterly. No, its fine. Lee Ui Chae gulped saliva and answered. There was a bit of regret lingering in his face but it also showed that it didnt matter. There are also many other parts in which you can support me besides financial matters. Tell me about them. \u2026This subject can be a bit\u2026 sensitive. So I hope the young master can listen until the end. Lee Ui Chae looked clearly nervous. He drank some water from the cup that was on the table and opened his mouth. If I speak in a direct manner, I need connections. I dont care where it is but I hope you can entrust me with the trading rights of provisions for an army. The amount I have isnt huge but I can prepare provisions for a war middling in scale These were obvious words but there was no way that the Murim Association or the Righteous Faction would farm. Even if they did, it was only the amount for them to eat. Thats why if they wanted to obtain provisions, they had to buy them from merchants. Most of them traded through outer disciples or people related by blood to formal disciples. The amount and the money being traded wasnt low at all so it couldnt be entrusted to just anyone. They needed an introduction. And\u2026 Lee Ui Chae showed to be really cautious. He glanced at Ju Seo Cheons face several times. It seemed like he wanted to say something but he kept opening and closing his mouth as if he couldnt say it out loud. Ju Seo Cheon knew fully well why he was acting like that but he pretended to not know anything and said. I wont get angry so just tell me. I promise I will make a judgement after listening to everything. Lee Ui Chae also regained courage at those words. \u2026Young master should have participated in the major meetings where the Fourteenth Gallant Sword and the branch manager of Kaiyang participated in, am I right? Yes. Then, I believe you also know about the war regions of Guizhou. Thats why I was saying\u2026can you tell me about isolated places or places that have difficulty in receiving provisions? Lee Ui Chae finished speaking and closed his eyes. It was because he was scared of how Ju Seo Cheon would act. The problem this posed was something a twelve year old kid, no not even a 17 year old kid, could know. Lee Ui Chae was requesting information that was classified to be secret and his intentions were clear. It was because finding places that have problems in receiving provisions and receiving rice to them would make him more money. \u2018Ha, his greed is no joke just like what I heard about him.

Do you know about the treasury of the Three Eyed Immoral God?","title":"Vocanic Age Chapter 29"},{"location":"volcanic-30/","text":"Vocanic Age Chapter 30 Editor: Imagine Lee ui Chae couldnt contain his surprise when he heard the words that came out of Ju Seo Cheons words. Dear God, the Treasury of the Three Eyed Immoral God! It wasnt too much to say that he was doubting his ears. The Water Spirit Fruit I consumed a few years ago wasnt discovered in an underwater cave but in this treasury. Ju Seo Cheon lied on purpose. It was to make Lee Ui Chae believe in him a little bit more. The concept of the treasury itself was so absurd he had to dress it up in lies. What will you do? Mmm. Lee Ui Chae stayed silent. It seemed like he was thinking how he should receive this news. \u2018His eyes dont seem like theyre lying\u2026 Those were eyes that didnt shake at all and had a strong conviction. They were so upright and clean it sucked you in. He didnt think for long. Lee Ui Chae put down his belief for a moment and spoke out the doubt that popped up in his head. Leaving aside the existence of the treasury, how are you planning to move that many treasures secretly? That is realistically impossible. The number of treasures lying dormant in the treasure wasnt low at all. They had to mobilize a lot of people for it. Thats why it would inevitably get exposed. And the biggest problem was the people they would have to mobilize. People were weak in front of treasures. They may change their attitudes and turn into robbers. If that was the case, they would have to find people that wouldnt hit them in the back but that wasnt something easy to do. Mobilizing disciples of Mount Hua was the most certain thing but if that happened, nothing much would return to Lee Ui Chae. No, in the first place it was doubtful whether they would let him in. Its realistically impossible to get all the treasures with only our strength. I dont know if its you but the treasures would certainly fly away at the hand of robbers if the treasures are in the hand of a small merchant like me. Theres no need to take all of it. And by that you mean\u2026? Its fine even if its a little as its better to find people that can be trusted. Then, I will enter the treasury with those people and only take the most valuable things. It will be enough even if we share that. Indeed. Originally he had also planned to mobilize the most they could. He hadnt been looking for the merchant king for nothing. It was because he thought that he would already be a merchant with some standing. But his circumstances werent as good as he thought. He didnt think that Lee Ui Chae would have nothing. He had set up a plan to mobilize about a hundred to two hundred people but he was wrong. Thats why he modified his plans as soon as he saw him. To give up on quantity and aim for quality. The small merchant in front of him, no, the merchant king, was as valuable as the treasury. And what the merchant king was lacking right now was capital. He would be able to perform well alone if only he had the funds. It would be much more valuable if he made Lee Ui Chae indebted with a debt that couldnt be paid. The merchant king went crazy with money but he was also the most reliable person in business. If you keep shut about this proposal and you accept, I will make it so that your Golden Merchant Business is able to take care of the provisions of Weng An. I understand. But great master. If the treasury really exists, why are you entrusting it to me? Suspicion and confusion appeared in Lee Ui Chaes eyes. Ju Seo Cheon laughed out loud. Look, merchant I dont have anything. If I were to ask help from a more renowned merchant, tell me, would they trust a child? There is not much time. I will probably be leaving tomorrow or after two days. The time the Lotus Peak members would be in Kang Ho wasnt long and they had already accumulated enough experience so there was no reason to stay back. I will do it. Lee Ui Chae didnt think for long. If Ju Seo Cheons words were true, then this was a big opportunity. On top of that even if it wasnt the treasury, just lending him the rights to trade the provisions for Weng An was enough for him. Above all, his instincts were yelling at him not to give up on this opportunity. His nose had been paralyzed long ago due to the smell of money. His body heated up as if he was drunk. Then, let me tell you about the details. The smile in Ju Seo Cheons face became denser. Ju Seo Cheon told a part of his plans about the treasury to Lee Ui Chae. It didnt matter if the merchant king believed in him or not. He would listen to a request if profits were promised to him. After he separated with Lee Ui Chae, he returned to the branch in Kae An immediately and sent a letter he had prepared beforehand through a carrier pigeon. The receiver was Jang Tak. That was the name of the second rate warrior that fought with him in Weng An. Jang Taks position in Weng An was higher than he thought. He was the right hand of the branch manager that participated in the battle of Kae An. And he had heard before leaving that he would become a sub branch manager because of the merits he accumulated this time. If it was Jang Tak, that was undoubted to him, he wouldnt just listen to his request but would try his best to fulfill it and there were several others that were indebted to Ju Seo Cheon so he didnt need to worry about it. There was a separate thing he should worry about. We are going to return to Mount Hua tomorrow so get ready. The feast ended and the order to return to Mount Hua sect had already been given. It was now time to return. He couldnt stay in this place anymore. Jang Hong and Jang Seo Eun felt regret. The freedom they tasted after having lived as a fourth generation disciple under strict rules was really sweet. The freedom it gave was that much charming even though it was life threatening. We wont go to the Shaolin Faction, the Shaman Faction, or the other branches of the Murim Association in Anhui? Jang Seo Eun pulled on the sleeves of Gu Pung and looked up at him. It was a cuteness all men would fall for. \u2018You are doing well! Keep doing that! Ju Seo Cheon cheered Jang Seo Eun inwardly. But his cheers were for naught. Gu Pung put on a troubled expression and shook his head with strict eyes. I also want to show you more things but unfortunately that will be a bit heart. I dont think my heart will be able to endure it. Ah, please senior uncle~ Hang Jong also acted cute but it didnt work. Coming to Kang Ho is originally meant to accumulate experience, its not as dangerous as this. What happened this time was an exception. Fortunately, you didnt get hurt but the main office is also worried about you and already said that it would be for the best to return. So we cant do anything even if its regretful. The expedition to Kang Ho had ended. They werent able to do anything about it and had to return. \u2018They say that worldly affairs dont go as planned\u2026 Originally he had been planning to receive the help of Lee Ui Chae when he was about to return to Mount Hua and slip away to go raid the treasury. I needed time but that got drastically reduced. A fortune among misfortunes was that the Zhuge Sega also received the order to return and that they would be able to stay together until the Midlands, where the treasury was located. He needed the help of Zhuge Seung Kye to disarm the mechanisms of the treasury. But the problem was what came after that. \u2018Ive set up the trade but I cant ask the merchant king to follow us. Even if we go to the Midlands and somehow raid the treasury, we have to return to Guizhou. But how? Mount Hua would certainly intervene if he told Gu Pung about the treasury and it would be the worst if Zhuge Sang heard him. No, in the first place there was no way they would believe in the existence of the treasury. Even if he took Zhuge Seung Kye, it was going to be hard to evade the eyes and senses of a pinnacle expert like Gu Pung. In the end Ju Seo Cheon was sent off by several people before he could finish his thoughts and left Guizhou. The time it took to return wasnt long. They received horses that were as good as named horses when they left Kaiyan. Horse riding skills were also taught in the Lotus Peak. It wasnt an institution of geniuses for nothing. The reason they didnt ride on a horse since Mount Hua was to train in their foot techniques, not because they didnt know how to ride a horse. The Zhuge Sega also showed excellent riding skills. Even them, that seemed to have no reflexes, rode on horses quite well. It was because the martial arts and the internal energy of the household itself was low and the Light Step Arts, that consumed a lot of internal energy, didnt suit them. Several horses left dust clouds behind their trails while riding. There were eighteen horses. Four for Mount Hua, another four for the Zhuge Sega and ten warriors of Kaiyan that Shin Do Gyun sent as escorts. The group didnt stop except for sleeping, eating, or when they were really exhausted and continued riding and thanks to that they were able to arrive at Guizhou early. Some group of bandits appeared but they fled immediately when they saw the group that didnt seem normal even at first glance. For Ju Seo Cheon, this situation really drove him crazy. Gu Pungs eyes were bothersome but there were watchmen in the name of guards. His insides burned down. The River of Death. Sect lord, we received news that the Fourteenth Gallant Sword is going to arrive at Yangtze river soon. A commander of the River of Death, Ak Gwan Tae, read the report. Is he here? The lord opened his eyes, they resembled that of a beast. He released killing intent that had displeasure and rage mixed in. My anger doesnt get eased up even after decapitating the fools that attacked Weng An but escaped. They are trying to return safe and sane? The matter in Kae An wasnt that big. Battles in that region occurred as frequently as having meals. If it was serious, the owner of that territory changed about ten times in a day. It wasnt something to be that angry as was an everyday occurrence. I wouldnt be this angry if we had lost like usual. Defeat wasnt that important. That happened so frequently that they just let it slide and prepared for the next attack. But the problem was that it was a \u2018complete defeat. The sect lord wasnt the one to prepare it directly but the sect had prepared quite a bit for the battle. The commander Ak Gwan Tae intervened a little bit in examining the decoy tactic and approved it. They had expected the Fourteenth Gallant Sword to lead the remaining forces and enter the battle in Kaiyan. But the problem was that they werent able to conquer the empty house in Weng An. If they had succeeded in it, they would have secured hostages to deal big damages. But that didnt turn out that way and got defeated completely. The result of that birthed his humiliation and rage. Ju Seo Cheons actions ended up changing the future. It was a future that wouldnt have occurred originally. Weng An got conquered and they had to retreat from Kaiyan because of the hostages. But a changed future would also change another part of the future. Teach those brats of Mount Hua a lesson. The eyes of the sect lord shone slyly. Yangtze, at the harbor. Hm? Gu Pung tilted his head. Whats the matter Fourteenth Gallant Sword? Zhuge Sak saw Gu Pung act like that and looked at him strangely. Ah, its nothing much. I was just wondering why there arent many ships. Zhuge Sak checked his surroundings at Gu Pungs words. There were certainly not many ships and there were no small boats at all. It is indeed weird. At this time of the year, tourists that come to enjoy the view of the Yangtze are overflowing. And it wont matter much because we have many people, right? Haha. Zhuge Sak touched his beard and laughed. The group didnt ride on a skiff but on a middle sized ship that could easily accommodate fifty people. They could ride in two separate skiffs but then, it became meaningless to have brought warriors to guard them. In addition, it wasnt that they had no money so there was no reason to put up with that discomfort.","title":"volcanic-30"},{"location":"volcanic-30/#vocanic-age-chapter-30","text":"Editor: Imagine Lee ui Chae couldnt contain his surprise when he heard the words that came out of Ju Seo Cheons words.

In the end Ju Seo Cheon was sent off by several people before he could finish his thoughts and left Guizhou. The time it took to return wasnt long. They received horses that were as good as named horses when they left Kaiyan. Horse riding skills were also taught in the Lotus Peak. It wasnt an institution of geniuses for nothing. The reason they didnt ride on a horse since Mount Hua was to train in their foot techniques, not because they didnt know how to ride a horse. The Zhuge Sega also showed excellent riding skills. Even them, that seemed to have no reflexes, rode on horses quite well. It was because the martial arts and the internal energy of the household itself was low and the Light Step Arts, that consumed a lot of internal energy, didnt suit them. Several horses left dust clouds behind their trails while riding. There were eighteen horses. Four for Mount Hua, another four for the Zhuge Sega and ten warriors of Kaiyan that Shin Do Gyun sent as escorts. The group didnt stop except for sleeping, eating, or when they were really exhausted and continued riding and thanks to that they were able to arrive at Guizhou early. Some group of bandits appeared but they fled immediately when they saw the group that didnt seem normal even at first glance. For Ju Seo Cheon, this situation really drove him crazy. Gu Pungs eyes were bothersome but there were watchmen in the name of guards. His insides burned down. The River of Death. Sect lord, we received news that the Fourteenth Gallant Sword is going to arrive at Yangtze river soon. A commander of the River of Death, Ak Gwan Tae, read the report. Is he here? The lord opened his eyes, they resembled that of a beast. He released killing intent that had displeasure and rage mixed in. My anger doesnt get eased up even after decapitating the fools that attacked Weng An but escaped. They are trying to return safe and sane? The matter in Kae An wasnt that big. Battles in that region occurred as frequently as having meals. If it was serious, the owner of that territory changed about ten times in a day. It wasnt something to be that angry as was an everyday occurrence. I wouldnt be this angry if we had lost like usual. Defeat wasnt that important. That happened so frequently that they just let it slide and prepared for the next attack. But the problem was that it was a \u2018complete defeat. The sect lord wasnt the one to prepare it directly but the sect had prepared quite a bit for the battle. The commander Ak Gwan Tae intervened a little bit in examining the decoy tactic and approved it. They had expected the Fourteenth Gallant Sword to lead the remaining forces and enter the battle in Kaiyan. But the problem was that they werent able to conquer the empty house in Weng An. If they had succeeded in it, they would have secured hostages to deal big damages. But that didnt turn out that way and got defeated completely. The result of that birthed his humiliation and rage. Ju Seo Cheons actions ended up changing the future. It was a future that wouldnt have occurred originally. Weng An got conquered and they had to retreat from Kaiyan because of the hostages. But a changed future would also change another part of the future. Teach those brats of Mount Hua a lesson. The eyes of the sect lord shone slyly. Yangtze, at the harbor. Hm? Gu Pung tilted his head. Whats the matter Fourteenth Gallant Sword? Zhuge Sak saw Gu Pung act like that and looked at him strangely. Ah, its nothing much. I was just wondering why there arent many ships. Zhuge Sak checked his surroundings at Gu Pungs words. There were certainly not many ships and there were no small boats at all. It is indeed weird. At this time of the year, tourists that come to enjoy the view of the Yangtze are overflowing. And it wont matter much because we have many people, right? Haha. Zhuge Sak touched his beard and laughed. The group didnt ride on a skiff but on a middle sized ship that could easily accommodate fifty people. They could ride in two separate skiffs but then, it became meaningless to have brought warriors to guard them. In addition, it wasnt that they had no money so there was no reason to put up with that discomfort.","title":"Vocanic Age Chapter 30"},{"location":"volcanic-31/","text":"Vocanic Age Chapter 31 It seems like you have become sensitive because of what happened at Weng An. How about going inside and resting? Thats not necessary but thank you for your consideration. Gu Pung thought that he had indeed been too sensitive and let it pass. He calmed himself and enjoyed the scenery. He wasnt holding a bottle of alcohol but the view of Yangtze that was enough to enjoy without alcohol appeared before their eyes. The cliffs that were lined up could only be seen entirely after completely looking upwards, and the dense thicket made you think of a world that didnt belong to humans. At first they had dropped their mouths when looking at the Yangtze river. They were overwhelmed by this great nature and their bodies became stiff. They had gotten quite accustomed to its view by now but the scenery of the Yangtze river was as impressive as ever. If they stuck out their heads from the ship, they would be able to see fishes dancing under the flowing water. Gu Pung, who was reminscing the past while looking at the water, opened his eyes widely. Warriors of the Murim Assoction, listen! Srung. The sword hanging on Gu Pungs waist was pulled smoothly. A rough and keen aura was released from his sword. Protect the members of the Lotus Peak and the Zhuge Sega! Fourteenth Gallant Sword\u2026? Zhuge Zak put on a surprised expression. The warriors of the Murim Association moved at the same time and set up a defensive formation before Zhuge Zak could even ask anything. Hmph! The Fourteenth Gallant Sword indeed, you are quite fast on catching on things! Zhuge Zaks face hardened in an instant. His eyes moved quickly to find the owner of the voice. Above the cliff, the dense thicket rustled and then men dressed in blue appeared. Get on the ship! Someones voice echoed in the air. Splash, splash! Huk! A warrior of the Murim Association yelled. The tranquil river suddenly spurted up and several unsightly men got on the ship. But there werent one or two or them. There were easily about thirty of them. D, damn it Its shaking! The number of people that could get on the ship was at most sixty and its center started to shake because there were too many people on the ship. The Nine Fleets of the Water Forest Zhuge Zak yelled with a pale face. There werent many people that could swim in the Yangtze river and that was because the water currents would constantly keep on changing. No, in the first place, one had to master the Arts of Water to properly be able to follow a ship while diving underwater. The pirates were the only martial artists that had mastered the Arts of Water in the Yangtze River. I will let this matter rest if you have gotten on the wrong boat so get off immediately. Gu Pung showed the plum blossom engraved in his sleeves slightly and warned them in a low voice. Haha. This is not the first time we are meeting so theres no way we came to the wrong ship, right? The man that had the biggest physique among the pirates stood forward. You are\u2026 A face filled with scars. There werent many people with this characteristic. You wont know me because I didnt tell you my name last time. Im called Yook Dae Rang. I am grateful for the wage you gave me last time. Huhu. Yook Dae Rang showed his yellow teeth and smiled coarsely. Ah! The pirate from back then! Jang Hong recognized Yook Dae Rang. Only then did Gu Pung, Jang Seo Eun and Ju Seo Cheon remember who that man was. It was the head of the pirates they had met when they first crossed the Yangtze River from the Midlands. Whe, when you say Yook Dae Rang\u2026 Zhuge Zak mumbled with a trembling voice. One of the Hundred Experts, the Slipping Water Spearaman! And Zhuge Sang followed his words. Ho, its so moving that a prideful high noble of the Five Segas recognizes me. Im about to cry. Yook Dae Rang laughed gloomily. The atmosphere of the group cooled down in an instant at that reaction and the faces of the warriors of the Murim Association showed deep despair. Yook Dae Rang took out the long spear he was carrying on his back and then spun it and stabbed the ground. The ship that was shaking severely without being able to stay balanced stopped and lay stably. \u2018Hes the real deal. Gu Pung gulped dry saliva. What business does the Slipping Water Spearman have in this ship? What business? Kuhahaha! Yook Dae Rang tilted his head back and laughed. That wasnt an enjoyable laughter at all. For you to ask a pirate what business they have when getting on another ship\u2026 Are you seriously asking that? Yook Dae Rangs way of speaking changed and a chill could be felt from his voice. Slipping Water Spearman, did you go crazy! Zhuge Zak yelled among the guards. And all the gazes in the surrounding area turned to look at Zhuge Zak. Im crazy? You are attacking the ship where the future of Mount Hua and Zhuge Sega are at. You wont be able to get away safely with this! Ho, the Zhuge Sega indeed. You are quite outstanding on falsely incriminating others. Yook Dae Rang laughed. Listen well. We are the Nine Fleets of the Water Forest. The protectors of the Yangtze River. Yook Dae Rang wet his lips with his tongue. There has been a tradition from long ago to pay a passage fee to the protectors guarding Yangtze. However, werent you the ones that spoke ill about us saying that we were a group of bandits and paid for the fee by yourselves? In the first place, you were the ones that picked a fight with us. Ha? What kind of nonsense\u2026 Zhuge Zak wanted to continue speaking but stopped. He understood what was going to happen looking at how Yook Dae Rang was smiling. The first ones that repelled are those arrogant brats of the Lotus Peak and the Zhuge Sega, am I not right? Didnt they raise their swords saying that they wouldnt negotiate with pirates? Yook Dae Rang raised his spear and pointed at a body of a warrior. Uncle, it seems like theres something behind this. They arent planning on letting us go. Zhuge Sang grabbed his sword that was hanging on his waist. He didnt know how much help he would be but the situation was that serious. So the reason there were no ships on the harbor\u2026it was like this? Gu Pung grinded his teeth. Not knowing the forces of Murim and making mistakes, isnt that something that \u2018happens frequently in your first expedition to Kang Ho? Yook Dae Rang gripped his spear with more strength. The muscles in his hands, wrist and shoulders swelled up greatly. If I tell you about it again, the Yangtze River is the territory of the Nine Fleets of the Water Forest. You caused problems in this place so we are just protecting the law and peace as the guardians of Yangtze. Hahaha! Yook Dae Rangs laughter resonated loudly. Dont leave anyone alive! Kehehe! The pirates charged forward. Huh? Bewildered voice came out by their own. Ju Seo Cheon couldnt understand what was happening right now. Fellow brother, hide behind me! Jang Hong still acted like older brother and stepped forward. Suran! Seung Kye! Zhuge Sang also hid his little siblings behind him. Ju Seo Cheon, Zhuge Suran and Zhuge Seung Kye took cover in the middle and Zhuge Sang, Jang Hong and Jang Seo Eun surrounded them. Lastly, the warriors of the Murim Association took a defensive formation around them. You could feel deep resolution in each one of them. \u2018Just what is happening? He had thought that everything had ended when he boarded the ship. He was also thinking about whether he should throw himself out of the ship along with Zhuge Seung Kye. But something unexpected occurred. \u2018There is no way I wouldnt remember it if they fought against the Slipping Water Spearman\u2026 Did this originally happen? The Hundred Experts changed really frequently based on the era and that was especially the case in the era of war. It changed so quickly that information couldnt catch up with it. However, there still some people that didnt get their positions taken from them and remained as one of the Hundred Experts for a long time. One of those people was the Slipping Water Spearman, Yook Dae Rang. Yook Dae Rang was originally a seaman in the army. But one day he fought with his superior and ended up killing him as he couldnt endure his anger and after that, he escaped because a bounty was put on him. He somehow ended up getting himself enrolled in the Nine Fleets of the Water Forest while fleeing. Originally, he had just planning to hide for a while but he realized that the pirate life suited him too well. There was no need to endure rotten personalities and Yook Dae Rang was originally a strong person so he managed to climb to a high position in no time. He stayed in that place and became a pirate. There were two big reasons on why he could remember Yook Dae Rang. One was that the Nine Fleets of the Water Forest didnt have that many experts and the second was that Yook Dae Rang lived a long life. The Nine Fleets of the Water Forest was an annoying force that not even the government could do anything about. They needed power to exterminate them but the governments of Xian and Ming had to face the northern barbarians so they had to concentrate their forces on land soldiers, and they were weak in their naval force. They werent even thinking of strengthening them either. Even if it was called a naval force it only was only inside of the Yangtze river which was inside their country. It was much better to be cautious of the countries at the west of China that were outside the Midlands. Because of this, they lack manpower to subjugate the Nine Fleets of the Water Forest and it was hard to catch Yook Dae Rang, that didnt leave the Yangtze River. Most of all, Yook Dae Rang was at the top among the Hundred Experts when he was in the Yangtze River because of the characteristics of the Water Arts. There was no way rumors wouldnt have spread if Gu Pung and the famous Yook Dae Rang had fought. It was weird if he had no memories of it at all. \u2018Its a future I havent experienced! His head spun quickly. Thoughts he could guess passed in his head as fast as lightning. Kuaagh! Ju Seo Cheon stopped his thoughts for a moment at the screams that were heard in the surroundings and got a hold of himself. \u2018Its not the time to be thinking leisurely! The other warriors seemed quite weak. They were at most second rate. In the first place, how strong could bandits be? They had been scared at the appearance of the Slipping Water Spearman but they were strong enough to face the pirates. Chaeng! Chaeng Chae chaeng! Kuut! Hahahaha! But the problem were Gu Pung and Yook Dae Rang. Not much time passed since the battle started but they could already see Gu Pung having a hard time. \u2018Its a battle thats overwhelmingly disadvantageous for senior uncle. In the first place, the Water Arts were martial arts made to fight on a ship and under the water. It was obvious that Yook Dae Rang held the advantage. Most of all, he had lived half of his life as a seaman. In the other hand, Gu Pung was greatly affected even at the slight shake of the ship and he was also not accustomed to fighting on the deck of a ship. He might have been able to win if Yook Dae Rang was weak but unfortunately he was one of the Hundred Experts! \u2018I have to help him. Ju Seo Cheon grabbed his sword. It didnt matter if his real skills were discovered here as they were in a situation where his neck could be sent flying even with a little bit of carelessness. \u2018I cant die here! Ju Seo Cheons face contorted hoarsely. Uaaagh! Plop! One warrior of the Murim Association got cornered by the pirates and got thrown off the ship while he was thinking. Dont kill the girl! Hohoho, that girl looks really tasty! Their contorted eyes headed towards Zhuge Suran. Even her, that was emotionless until now, trembled at that gaze as if it felt bad and frowned. Kehehe! A pirate found an opening and extended his hand. His objective was Zhuge Suran. No! Zhuge Sangs sword change trajectories in a hurry but he was too late. The hands of the pirate was too fast. \u2018Get under water li\u2026huh? The pirate opened his eyes roundly. He couldnt see his hand that had tried to snatch the frail wrist of Zhuge Suran. Just wh\u2026Kuhuk! The pirate clenched his chest and fell back. There was a small hole in the pit of his stomach. Fellow brother\u2026? Jang Seo Eun couldnt shut her surprised mouth and looked at Ju Seo Cheon. Ju Seo Cheon shook off his sword and scattered the blood on the floor. Im going.","title":"volcanic-31"},{"location":"volcanic-31/#vocanic-age-chapter-31","text":"It seems like you have become sensitive because of what happened at Weng An.

Originally, he would glance at the members of the Lotus Peak even in the middle of his fight but he hadnt done so even once after starting his fight. It meant that the situation was that serious. I am going to go and help my senior uncle, so leave aside the needless worries and dont interfere. Its a warning. Younger brother, are you out of your mind? Jang Hong looked at Ju Seo Cheon as if he was saying something absurd. He looked at Ju Seo Cheon as if he was looking at a madman. Im going. At times, it would be more clear to show it with your actions rather than with words. Ah! The warrior of the Murim Association that was at the forefront let out a bewildered voice. It was because Ju Seo Cheon passed the guards even before they could stop him and approached the pirates in an instant. No! Jang Hong yelled and tried to chase him back. You cant! However, the warrior of the Murim Association stopped Jang Hong as if he wouldnt let it happen twice. Let me go! My younger brother\u2026 Jang Hong couldnt continue speaking and shut his mouth. Disbelief and shock appeared on his face. Just what\u2026? Even Zhuge Zak doubted his eyes. No, it wasnt only him. Everyone was like that except for Gu Pung. Their eyes were looking at Ju Seo Cheon swinging his sword flashily among the pirates. Wh, what is he! A comparatively small pirate let out a bewildered voice. Something flashed in front of him and the head of a comrade that was by his side flew off. He felt like a ghost had possessed him. I dont have time so come at me all at once. Ju Seo Cheon opened his eyes sharply. Those eyes resembled the eyes of a beast. \u2018Wh, what kind of eyes\u2026 The small pirate trembled. His body didnt listen to him the moment he looked at those eyes. You idiot! Catch the brat quickly! Another pirate charged forward. He was a pirate that was made fun of for not being aware of his surroundings. And that mistake of his called for his own death. Ju Seo Cheon took half a step sideways to lightly dodge the sword that attacked with the intent to smash his head and stabbed at the side of the pirate. Kuhuk! The sword stabbed his lungs through the side. The pirate felt his breath clog and his consciousness faded away. From now on I wont be able to take care of you so you should bear this in mind, warriors. You shouldnt focus on being on the offensive but being on the defensive Ju Seo Cheon pulled out his sword from the pirates lungs and then kicked the pirate that had difficulty breathing into the Yangtze River. \u2018Plum Blossom Haze Sword! A pleasant feeling spread through Ju Seo Cheons hands. The technique released great power because Ju Seo Cheon had completed all twelve stars of it. Pabat! Kuogh! One pirate bent his body backwards and Ju Seo Cheons sword grazed his chin with a narrow margin. Hm. I will have to get accustomed to it a bit. Not even Ju Seo Cheon had much experience fighting on a ship as there the times he had to fight on waters could be counted on one hand. Originally, the sword line that was drawn horizontally should have cut off his head but he wasnt able to do so. Ju Seo Cheon controlled his senses once again and stabbed down his sword on the chest of the pirate that wanted to stand up. Kuk! The flow of the internal energy was disrupted as the sword struck precisely on his forehead. His brain stiffened and he lost consciousness as his muscles loosened up. There was no hesitation in Ju Seo Cheons movements. He continued attacking even more fiercely as if trying to kill one more enemy. You rat like bastard! When he glanced sideways to find the origin of the voice, he saw a pirate at his left charging at him while holding an axe. Ju Seo Cheon kicked the pirate he was facing and raised his sword to block the axe. Sparks flew with the sound of metal clashing. Grrrrr! The pirate used all his strength to push the axe forward and his face turned red. But his axe didnt move an inch even when he used all his strength. Hat! Ju Seo Cheon let out a yell almost for the first time since the battle. He started to parry up the axe upwards and the axe stabbed the forehead of the pirate like that. Keugh! The pirate let out his last cry and fell without strength. Hii, hiiik! Close to ten pirates lost their lives in an instant and they started to feel fear and uneasiness only then. \u2018Five Elements Plum Blossom Sword Art. Ju Seo Cheon changed sword techniques. Swift sword techniques werent good to use because of the shaking of the ship. It was much better to use the Five Elements Plum Blossom Sword Art as stability and balance were its focus. His fierce intent changed but that didnt mean that he was going easy on his enemies. He boasted great stability that people watching him felt comfortable and took the lives of the pirates. \u2018Ugh. Originally, I should be able to take care of them after exchanging only a few blows with them but I cant do that well as my boundary is low. Should I have increased my rank if I had known that I would be revealing my martial arts like this? Ju Seo Cheons boundary was a bit vague, so to say. He had already completed the Plum Blossom Life Arts long ago and he stopped practicing the Universal Plum Blossom Breathing Method when it reached the ten stars on purpose. It was because he felt like his boundary was going to increase if he completed it. If his martial arts increased in overall, he would unavoidably stand out even if he didnt want that. It was because something like aura would come out from his body. It would be troublesome if he attracted attention so he didnt complete it on purpose and also didnt increase his rank. But it didnt matter for the sword techniques as he was able to control it as much as he wanted so he had used the intelligence as the Grand Master and completed all of them. His skills in the sword was at the Grand Master rank, his martial arts were second rate and if he went a bit overboard it was first rate so it was hard to classify him properly. Whatever the case, if his boundary was low then his body wouldnt be able to follow it so even if his sword was perfect it would soon strain his body. Currently Ju Seo Cheon was in that state. He tried to perform high leveled techniques that didnt match with his body so the balance was about to break. \u2018The same goes for Master but I cant waste anymore time! Ju Seo Cheons movements became fast and changed. They couldnt contain their shock while watching the things unfolding below them. What is that! At first, they couldnt understand why they were tasked with the role of reconnaissance. It was to observe and report if something happened just in case. But who was it that was below there! The Slipping Water Spearman and a Hundred Expert that reigned as being almost the absolute strongest in Yangtze River. On top of that, even if all the other pirates were third rate, they werent at a disadvantage at all as they were on the Yangtze River. They didnt doubt their victory as the situation was too advantageous for them. They took a leisurely drink and chatted among them. But something unexpected happened not long after the battle started. You said that he was the flashy yet frail one! They had somewhat heard information about their opponents before ambushing them and the nicknames they were called with in Mount Hua was also known by the pirates. A brat of the Lotus Peak that had internal energy but had nothing besides that. They had evaluated that he would fall easily with some light attacks. Thats not the case at all! Their information was wrong. They didnt know if Ju Seo Cheon was hiding it or if their information was wrong. He was such a monster that they couldnt believe the nickname he had at all. Ju Seo Cheon was massacring their allied pirates regardless of being in a disadvantageous environment of being on top of a ship. There was no retreat for them. They could only charge forward and the numerous pirates spurted out blood and fell in the river. The kid swinging his sword without minding their situation at all was terror itself. Shouldnt we warn the fleet master? The Nine Fleets of the Water Forest was an association of nine separate fleets so there were obviously nine fleet masters and Yook Dae Rang was one of them. No, stop it. He is fighting against the Fourteenth Gallant Sword right now. It seems like the fleet master has an overwhelming advantage\u2026 he may lose concentration if we tell him that and he might get hurt. You should know well what happens then, right? Yook Dae Rang was quite cruel and brutal. There were already several comrades of them that got beheaded for no reason. Al, also\u2026will the fleet master really get defeated? Right, hes none other than the Slipping Water Spearman. Theres no way he will lose on water. Even if all the small fry get defeated, the one that will come out victorious in the end is the fleet master. The scouts gulped and looked below them. Che che cheng! The sword and the spear clashed several times. The two weapons swirled like a storm and the air exploded. \u2018What is it? Yook Dae Rang glanced beyond Gu Pungs shoulders. He could see that his underlings were screaming and falling down the ship. The reactions in front of him didnt seem normal at all, and something strange seemed to be happening. It was the existence of the flashy yet frail one, Ju Seo Cheon. Hat! Where are you looking at! There was no way the pinnacle expert Gu Pung wouldnt notice that. He thought that he had discovered an opening and stabbed him with his sword. Sweeeak! The tip of his sword drew a line and extended forward and then a terrible sound exploded. Hmph! Its useless! Yook Dae Rang raised his spear diagonally and the part that connected the shaft with the blade stopped Gu Pungs sword precisely. Its your mistake looking down on the warriors of the Murim Association! Gu Pung yelled gallantly. Compared to Yook Dae Rang, who had some leisure, Gu Pung was concentrating all his senses on this battle. He didnt know what was happening behind him. He just saw an opening in Yook Dae Rang and misunderstood that the warriors of the Murim Association were the ones acting actively. Tch! Yook Dae Rang clicked his tongue. Even if he held the advantage, he couldnt drop his guard in front of the Fourteenth Gallant Sword. His name wasnt spread in the Midlands for nothing. He would have won already if he was an opponent like that. It was proof that he was still fighting against him. \u2018Damn. Gu Pungs face contorted. It was only annoying for Yook Dae Rang but Gu Pungs situation was serious. The ship floating on the water shook and he was influenced by that shaking so there were also problems in his sword. I heard that the Fourteen Stances of the Plum Blossom Sword were amazing but that is only for when it is used on land. Nonsense! Didnt your sword shake just now? Yook Dae Rang smirked. Originally, that stab should have been a straight one but it trembled minutely. That wasnt done on purpose but rather, it turned out like that because they were on a ship. Compared to that, my Still Water Spear Arts doesnt shake and is really overwhelming kuhuhu. The source of the Still Water Spear Arts was the organisation. It was a spear technique that was granted to people with skills, not an ordinary soldier. He was that high levelled. The spear that unleashed above the water was fast, strong, precise and perfect. The shaking of the ship posed no problem at all. It was the opposite. It moved as if it had become one with the water. I now know how great the sword of Mount Hua is, so lets end this now. You were able to serve as an appetizer, Fourteenth Gallant Sword. Kwaaagh. Yook Dae Rang held his spear more tightly. Blue veins pouted out and his muscles twitched. Gu Pung tensed up as Yook Dae Rang changed gears. He concentrated all his senses and waited for the next attack. \u2018Its big trouble. Gu Pung also knew that Yook Dae Rang was acting partly as a scout and that made his insides burn down even more. If he used all of his strength, then he wouldnt be able to hold on for long. In the split second when they were looking at each other\u2013! Uaaaagh! A pirate screamed and got thrown over Gu Pungs head. His body increased in speed and almost squashed Yook Dae Rang. Hut! Yook Dae Rang swung his spear unconsciously and split the body of the flying pirate in half. Just what\u2026 Yook Dae Rang looked behind Gu Pung. Ju Seo Cheon was standing in that place. Hello Yook Dae Rang. Nice to meet you. From now on, I will kill you.","title":"volcanic-32"},{"location":"volcanic-32/#vocanic-age-chapter-32","text":"It seemed like Gu Pung wouldnt be able to hold on much longer against Yook Dae Rang. Originally, he would glance at the members of the Lotus Peak even in the middle of his fight but he hadnt done so even once after starting his fight. It meant that the situation was that serious. I am going to go and help my senior uncle, so leave aside the needless worries and dont interfere. Its a warning. Younger brother, are you out of your mind? Jang Hong looked at Ju Seo Cheon as if he was saying something absurd. He looked at Ju Seo Cheon as if he was looking at a madman. Im going. At times, it would be more clear to show it with your actions rather than with words. Ah! The warrior of the Murim Association that was at the forefront let out a bewildered voice. It was because Ju Seo Cheon passed the guards even before they could stop him and approached the pirates in an instant. No! Jang Hong yelled and tried to chase him back. You cant! However, the warrior of the Murim Association stopped Jang Hong as if he wouldnt let it happen twice. Let me go! My younger brother\u2026 Jang Hong couldnt continue speaking and shut his mouth. Disbelief and shock appeared on his face. Just what\u2026? Even Zhuge Zak doubted his eyes. No, it wasnt only him. Everyone was like that except for Gu Pung. Their eyes were looking at Ju Seo Cheon swinging his sword flashily among the pirates. Wh, what is he! A comparatively small pirate let out a bewildered voice. Something flashed in front of him and the head of a comrade that was by his side flew off. He felt like a ghost had possessed him. I dont have time so come at me all at once. Ju Seo Cheon opened his eyes sharply. Those eyes resembled the eyes of a beast. \u2018Wh, what kind of eyes\u2026 The small pirate trembled. His body didnt listen to him the moment he looked at those eyes. You idiot! Catch the brat quickly! Another pirate charged forward. He was a pirate that was made fun of for not being aware of his surroundings. And that mistake of his called for his own death. Ju Seo Cheon took half a step sideways to lightly dodge the sword that attacked with the intent to smash his head and stabbed at the side of the pirate. Kuhuk! The sword stabbed his lungs through the side. The pirate felt his breath clog and his consciousness faded away. From now on I wont be able to take care of you so you should bear this in mind, warriors. You shouldnt focus on being on the offensive but being on the defensive Ju Seo Cheon pulled out his sword from the pirates lungs and then kicked the pirate that had difficulty breathing into the Yangtze River. \u2018Plum Blossom Haze Sword! A pleasant feeling spread through Ju Seo Cheons hands. The technique released great power because Ju Seo Cheon had completed all twelve stars of it. Pabat! Kuogh! One pirate bent his body backwards and Ju Seo Cheons sword grazed his chin with a narrow margin. Hm. I will have to get accustomed to it a bit. Not even Ju Seo Cheon had much experience fighting on a ship as there the times he had to fight on waters could be counted on one hand. Originally, the sword line that was drawn horizontally should have cut off his head but he wasnt able to do so. Ju Seo Cheon controlled his senses once again and stabbed down his sword on the chest of the pirate that wanted to stand up. Kuk! The flow of the internal energy was disrupted as the sword struck precisely on his forehead. His brain stiffened and he lost consciousness as his muscles loosened up. There was no hesitation in Ju Seo Cheons movements. He continued attacking even more fiercely as if trying to kill one more enemy. You rat like bastard! When he glanced sideways to find the origin of the voice, he saw a pirate at his left charging at him while holding an axe. Ju Seo Cheon kicked the pirate he was facing and raised his sword to block the axe. Sparks flew with the sound of metal clashing. Grrrrr! The pirate used all his strength to push the axe forward and his face turned red. But his axe didnt move an inch even when he used all his strength. Hat! Ju Seo Cheon let out a yell almost for the first time since the battle. He started to parry up the axe upwards and the axe stabbed the forehead of the pirate like that. Keugh! The pirate let out his last cry and fell without strength. Hii, hiiik! Close to ten pirates lost their lives in an instant and they started to feel fear and uneasiness only then. \u2018Five Elements Plum Blossom Sword Art. Ju Seo Cheon changed sword techniques. Swift sword techniques werent good to use because of the shaking of the ship. It was much better to use the Five Elements Plum Blossom Sword Art as stability and balance were its focus. His fierce intent changed but that didnt mean that he was going easy on his enemies. He boasted great stability that people watching him felt comfortable and took the lives of the pirates. \u2018Ugh. Originally, I should be able to take care of them after exchanging only a few blows with them but I cant do that well as my boundary is low.

He had spent a bit of strength in coming here. No, Ju Seo Cheon why are you\u2026 Gu Pungs eyes shook while looking at Ju Seo Cheon. The only emotions that appeared on his face were confusion and doubts. I understand how you are feeling right now senior uncle but nows not the time. We dont know how the ones that are above will act. Ju Seo Cheon glanced at the scouts that were on top of the cliffs. What did the warriors do instead of stopping Seo Cheon! Gu Pung raised his voice. For him, Ju Seo Cheons safety was a really sensitive subject. Th, that\u2026 The warriors of the Murim Association didnt know how to respond. They were still dumbfounded. Zhuge Suran opened her mouth when no one spoke. You wouldnt believe this but young master Ju annihilated most of the pirates here. Suran, its dangerous. You attract too much attention already. Zhuge Sang hid Zhuge Suran behind him. That was a logical judgement. What? Gu Pung was in disbelief but it seemed like it wasnt a lie as he checked the atmosphere in his surroundings. You didnt know either? Yook Dae Rang looked at Ju Seo Cheon as if it was unexpected. \u2026Is that true? Gu Pung looked at Ju Seo Cheon that was now standing by his side. Yes, senior uncle. Ju Seo Cheon nodded. Just how\u2026no, leave it. Gu Pung had a lot of things to say but he decided to save them. It wasnt the time to act leisurely. Lets speak again if we get out of this safely. I will help you. No, you will only hinder me. Gu Pung declined immediately. I understand that you have been hiding your skills but you chose the worst opponent. Honestly speaking, I think that you will only hinder me instead of helping me. It would be a different story if he was at the peak rank, but people below that were of no help. On top of that Ju Seo Cheon was someone he had to protect. He wouldnt be able to fight properly because he would be too worried about him. So just leave it to m\u2026 You, you really speak a lot! Yook Dae Rang cut off Gu Pungs words and jumped forward. The ship shook greatly as the big man took a gigantic step. Gu Pung pushed Ju Seo Cheon back and dashed forward. Hurap! Yook Dae Rang performed a stab with all his strength. The weight behind the spear wasnt normal at all. Gu Pung saw that and spinned halfway in his place. The spear grazed by his waist. After that Gu Pung spun once again and swung his sword. \u2018Okay! His sword was still shaking but he was certain this time. He believed that his would be to cut off the neck. Useless! Yook Dae Rang inserted internal energy in his feet and stomped down. Boom! Uwaak! The stern of the ship sprang out slightly due to the force that was generated from the bow. Water passed the handrails and entered the ship. The few pirates that remained and the Murim Association group were also bewildered as the ship shook suddenly. The one that was the most flustered was Gu Pung. His already unsteady sword completely lost its path at the great shaking. He tried to rearm himself but it was too late. Yook Dae Rang walked normally while everyone else had lost balance and attacked Gu Pung with his spear. Die! Gu Pung closed his eyes as he sensed his death. Who are you trying to touch! Ju Seo Cheon, who was waiting behind Gu Pung to guard him, stepped out and performed a sword technique towards Yook Dae Rang. Plum Blossom Falling Sunset? Gu Pung was shocked when he saw the sword technique that was performed in Ju Seo Cheons hands. It was the fifth stance of the Fourteen Stances of the Plum Blossom Sword. This arrogant brat\u2026! Yook Dae Rangs pride was hurt when Ju Seo Cheon stopped his own attack and his face contorted in rage. You already look disgusting enough so dont do that! Ju Seo Cheon cracked a joke and executed the next stance. His sword turned blurry and the sword fell from above. It was the sixth stance, Plum Blossom Falling Petals. Keok! Yook Dae Rang raised his spear above his head and somehow managed to block the attack. Ju Seo Cheon didnt stop and followed up with the next stance. Even the Plum Blossom Lined Confusion! Gu Pungs shock continued. The Fourteen Stances of the Plum Blossom Sword? Yook Dae Rangs face stiffened. He realized while receiving the attacks that the stances belonged to Gu Pungs swordsmanship. No, precisely speaking it was a sword technique of Mount Hua. \u2018Now! Gu Pungs eyes were also able to see Yook Dae Rangs restlessness. The sword technique Ju Seo Cheon displayed was truly shocking but he wasnt a fool to miss a golden opportunity such as this one. Gu Pung aimed for Yook Dae Rangs side and inched closer. He then stabbed with his sword like lightning. This damned! Yook Dae Rang raised up his internal energy and twisted his body. His insides hurt like hell because he suddenly changed the circulation of his internal energy. Buuuung! Gu Pungs sword tore apart Yook Dae Rangs flesh. They could see fat and flesh falling by the tip of the sword. Keok! Yook Dae Rang let out a groan from the pain he felt in his side but he did not have the luxury of being in pain. Movements that were messed up once were lethal in a battle between experts. And it was even more so if there were two enemies. Ju Seo Cheon continued to execute the Plum Blossom Lined Confusion stance. It was an unbearable mess that played with the eyes and senses of Yook Dae Rang. Screw off! Yook Dae Rang swung his spear. The aura that was contained in the blade of his spear changed into wind and stopped the confusing sword. Well done! Gu Pung praised Ju Seo Cheon and attacked Yook Dae Rangs back. He raised up all the internal energy in his body to form a sword aura. Yook Dae Rang turned his body hurriedly and parried off Gu Pungs sword aura. But his movements werent like before. The part that was torn away from his side was considerable. Pain followed him. Guuuugh! Yook Dae Rang wasnt able to contain his rage. It hurt his pride and annoyed him that he fell for such an attack. On top of that, he wasnt able to bear the fact that his underlings were watching all of this. If rumors about this spread in the Nine Fleets of the Water Forest, it was obvious that the other fleet masters would laugh at him saying that he got done by a kid. Fuck off! Yook Dae Rang swung his spear again. It produced a destructive power that could sweep away everything in its surroundings and was felt in all the ship. The force behind the spear created pressure and it spread in a circle with him as the center and even created waves. His full force attack headed towards Ju Seo Cheon first . \u2018No! Gu Pung moved quickly. Ju Seo Cheons strength was unexpected but he wasnt going to be able to stop that. That was what he thought. Heok! Ju Seo Cheon was also astonished at the pressure he could feel aimed all his body. That certainly wasnt normal. \u2018But\u2026this is an opportunity! A dense smile spread in Ju Seo Cheons face. He raised his sword and spun it. He pressed the side of his sword with his palm and inserted all his internal energy that was almost sixty years worth. Foolish brat! Yook Dae Rang laughed at Ju Seo Cheon. He was sure that he wouldnt be able to block this attack. Kuaaaang-! The spear clashed with the sword. Wh, what? But Yook Dae Rangs expectations were completely off. A kid a few times smaller than him stopped his spear with his sword. Ju Seo Cheon fell back about five steps. His footsteps were imprinted on the floor. Cough! But he wasnt able to block it perfectly. Ju Seo Cheon also vomited some blood. It would have been good if he could form a sword aura but unfortunately, Ju Seo Cheon hadnt reached that boundary yet. Instead, he utilized his vast internal energy ignorantly to block the attack. The almost sixty years worth of internal energy wasnt for show. Well done Seo Cheon! Gu Pung moved as if he was folding space. He was also using all his strength. Gu Pung dashed forward and stabbed his sword in Yook Dae Rangs back. Puuk! The tip of the sword tore apart the flesh of his back and pierced the chest that was at the opposite part. Kuhuk! Yook Dae Rang opened his eyes widely. Im, impossible\u2026 Yook Dae Rang bent his back and trembled. You lowered your guard, Slipping Water Spearman. Gu Pung pulled out his sword and fell back. I, I lowered my guard? Yook Dae Rang put a flustered expression. Kuhuk, dont kid with me\u2026 Who could have predicted a card like Ju Seo Cheon to appear? He executed the Fourteen Stances of the Plum Blossom Sword as well as a Plum Blossom Sword Examiner and even stopped his full force attack. Even if Zhuge Kong Ming returned, he wouldnt be able to predict something that was so out of common sense. The fleet master was defeated! Uaaak! Plop! The few pirates that survived threw themselves outside the ship. For them, doing this gave them more probabilities to survive. Damn\u2026 Yook Dae Rang mumbled with a spiteful voice. I, I cant\u2026. cant die\u2026alone! Yook Dae Rang yelled and grabbed his spear inversely. No! Gu Pung yelled urgently but it was too late. Yook Dae Rang had already raised his spear up high and stabbed it down. Baaaang! The bow of the ship, that had already become a mess because of Yook Dae Rang stamping down on it a while ago, couldnt endure this attack and was destroyed. The crack that formed in the bow spread like a spiderweb and covered the entire ship, and then it finally shattered in pieces. Uagh! Agh! Plop The survivors and the dead that were on the ship fell into the water without any exception. Yook Dae Rang, who had lived the longest among the Hundred Experts, was dragged into the pit of the Yangtze River first. Eopu, eopu! Zhuge Zak floundered. Grab this! A warrior of the Murim Association that was near him brought a plank and extended it to Zhuge Zak. It was a broken part of the ship. The water current is not fast, fortunately! Zhuge Sang yelled while entrusting his body to the ship fragment. Go to that rock! Gu Pung pointed at one point while swimming. It was a place where a rock, the size of a house was lined up. They could see that it was connected with land. It was a really fortunate thing. The group relied on each other and climbed the big rock. Cough, cough! Are all of you safe? None of you got hurt? Gu Pung raised his voice while coughing. He searched for the members of the Lotus Peak first. The first one that entered his eyes was Jang Seo Eun. Se, senior uncle! Jang Seo Eun yelled urgently with a pale face. The reason her face was pale wasnt only because the water was cold. I, I cant see younger brother! What\u2026? Gu Pungs complexion changed and he checked his surroundings. He was able to see Jang Hong and Jang Seo Eun but he wasnt able to see Ju Seo Cheon. He checked thoroughly as he may be hanging on another rock but he couldnt even see a hair. Seung Kye! Next to him, the voice of the anxious Zhuge Sang was heard. His eyes were also rolling busily and his complexion wasnt good either. Seung Kye, answer me if you are near! Seung Kye! Zhuge Sangs heart breaking voice rang out. This cant be\u2026 Gu Pung couldnt believe it. Ju Seo Cheon and Zhuge Seung Kye. Only those two were nowhere to be seen.","title":"volcanic-33"},{"location":"volcanic-33/#vocanic-age-chapter-33","text":"Ju Seo Cheon calmed his breathing.

After that Gu Pung spun once again and swung his sword. \u2018Okay! His sword was still shaking but he was certain this time. He believed that his would be to cut off the neck. Useless! Yook Dae Rang inserted internal energy in his feet and stomped down. Boom! Uwaak! The stern of the ship sprang out slightly due to the force that was generated from the bow. Water passed the handrails and entered the ship. The few pirates that remained and the Murim Association group were also bewildered as the ship shook suddenly. The one that was the most flustered was Gu Pung. His already unsteady sword completely lost its path at the great shaking. He tried to rearm himself but it was too late. Yook Dae Rang walked normally while everyone else had lost balance and attacked Gu Pung with his spear. Die! Gu Pung closed his eyes as he sensed his death. Who are you trying to touch! Ju Seo Cheon, who was waiting behind Gu Pung to guard him, stepped out and performed a sword technique towards Yook Dae Rang. Plum Blossom Falling Sunset? Gu Pung was shocked when he saw the sword technique that was performed in Ju Seo Cheons hands. It was the fifth stance of the Fourteen Stances of the Plum Blossom Sword. This arrogant brat\u2026! Yook Dae Rangs pride was hurt when Ju Seo Cheon stopped his own attack and his face contorted in rage. You already look disgusting enough so dont do that! Ju Seo Cheon cracked a joke and executed the next stance. His sword turned blurry and the sword fell from above. It was the sixth stance, Plum Blossom Falling Petals. Keok! Yook Dae Rang raised his spear above his head and somehow managed to block the attack. Ju Seo Cheon didnt stop and followed up with the next stance. Even the Plum Blossom Lined Confusion! Gu Pungs shock continued. The Fourteen Stances of the Plum Blossom Sword? Yook Dae Rangs face stiffened. He realized while receiving the attacks that the stances belonged to Gu Pungs swordsmanship. No, precisely speaking it was a sword technique of Mount Hua. \u2018Now! Gu Pungs eyes were also able to see Yook Dae Rangs restlessness. The sword technique Ju Seo Cheon displayed was truly shocking but he wasnt a fool to miss a golden opportunity such as this one. Gu Pung aimed for Yook Dae Rangs side and inched closer. He then stabbed with his sword like lightning. This damned! Yook Dae Rang raised up his internal energy and twisted his body. His insides hurt like hell because he suddenly changed the circulation of his internal energy. Buuuung! Gu Pungs sword tore apart Yook Dae Rangs flesh. They could see fat and flesh falling by the tip of the sword. Keok! Yook Dae Rang let out a groan from the pain he felt in his side but he did not have the luxury of being in pain. Movements that were messed up once were lethal in a battle between experts. And it was even more so if there were two enemies. Ju Seo Cheon continued to execute the Plum Blossom Lined Confusion stance. It was an unbearable mess that played with the eyes and senses of Yook Dae Rang. Screw off! Yook Dae Rang swung his spear. The aura that was contained in the blade of his spear changed into wind and stopped the confusing sword. Well done! Gu Pung praised Ju Seo Cheon and attacked Yook Dae Rangs back. He raised up all the internal energy in his body to form a sword aura. Yook Dae Rang turned his body hurriedly and parried off Gu Pungs sword aura. But his movements werent like before. The part that was torn away from his side was considerable. Pain followed him. Guuuugh! Yook Dae Rang wasnt able to contain his rage. It hurt his pride and annoyed him that he fell for such an attack. On top of that, he wasnt able to bear the fact that his underlings were watching all of this. If rumors about this spread in the Nine Fleets of the Water Forest, it was obvious that the other fleet masters would laugh at him saying that he got done by a kid. Fuck off! Yook Dae Rang swung his spear again. It produced a destructive power that could sweep away everything in its surroundings and was felt in all the ship. The force behind the spear created pressure and it spread in a circle with him as the center and even created waves. His full force attack headed towards Ju Seo Cheon first . \u2018No! Gu Pung moved quickly. Ju Seo Cheons strength was unexpected but he wasnt going to be able to stop that. That was what he thought. Heok! Ju Seo Cheon was also astonished at the pressure he could feel aimed all his body. That certainly wasnt normal. \u2018But\u2026this is an opportunity! A dense smile spread in Ju Seo Cheons face. He raised his sword and spun it. He pressed the side of his sword with his palm and inserted all his internal energy that was almost sixty years worth. Foolish brat! Yook Dae Rang laughed at Ju Seo Cheon. He was sure that he wouldnt be able to block this attack. Kuaaaang-! The spear clashed with the sword. Wh, what? But Yook Dae Rangs expectations were completely off. A kid a few times smaller than him stopped his spear with his sword. Ju Seo Cheon fell back about five steps. His footsteps were imprinted on the floor. Cough! But he wasnt able to block it perfectly. Ju Seo Cheon also vomited some blood. It would have been good if he could form a sword aura but unfortunately, Ju Seo Cheon hadnt reached that boundary yet. Instead, he utilized his vast internal energy ignorantly to block the attack. The almost sixty years worth of internal energy wasnt for show. Well done Seo Cheon! Gu Pung moved as if he was folding space. He was also using all his strength. Gu Pung dashed forward and stabbed his sword in Yook Dae Rangs back. Puuk! The tip of the sword tore apart the flesh of his back and pierced the chest that was at the opposite part. Kuhuk! Yook Dae Rang opened his eyes widely. Im, impossible\u2026 Yook Dae Rang bent his back and trembled. You lowered your guard, Slipping Water Spearman. Gu Pung pulled out his sword and fell back. I, I lowered my guard? Yook Dae Rang put a flustered expression. Kuhuk, dont kid with me\u2026 Who could have predicted a card like Ju Seo Cheon to appear? He executed the Fourteen Stances of the Plum Blossom Sword as well as a Plum Blossom Sword Examiner and even stopped his full force attack. Even if Zhuge Kong Ming returned, he wouldnt be able to predict something that was so out of common sense. The fleet master was defeated! Uaaak! Plop! The few pirates that survived threw themselves outside the ship. For them, doing this gave them more probabilities to survive. Damn\u2026 Yook Dae Rang mumbled with a spiteful voice. I, I cant\u2026. cant die\u2026alone! Yook Dae Rang yelled and grabbed his spear inversely. No! Gu Pung yelled urgently but it was too late. Yook Dae Rang had already raised his spear up high and stabbed it down. Baaaang! The bow of the ship, that had already become a mess because of Yook Dae Rang stamping down on it a while ago, couldnt endure this attack and was destroyed. The crack that formed in the bow spread like a spiderweb and covered the entire ship, and then it finally shattered in pieces. Uagh! Agh! Plop The survivors and the dead that were on the ship fell into the water without any exception. Yook Dae Rang, who had lived the longest among the Hundred Experts, was dragged into the pit of the Yangtze River first. Eopu, eopu! Zhuge Zak floundered. Grab this! A warrior of the Murim Association that was near him brought a plank and extended it to Zhuge Zak. It was a broken part of the ship. The water current is not fast, fortunately! Zhuge Sang yelled while entrusting his body to the ship fragment. Go to that rock! Gu Pung pointed at one point while swimming. It was a place where a rock, the size of a house was lined up. They could see that it was connected with land. It was a really fortunate thing. The group relied on each other and climbed the big rock. Cough, cough! Are all of you safe? None of you got hurt? Gu Pung raised his voice while coughing. He searched for the members of the Lotus Peak first. The first one that entered his eyes was Jang Seo Eun. Se, senior uncle! Jang Seo Eun yelled urgently with a pale face. The reason her face was pale wasnt only because the water was cold. I, I cant see younger brother! What\u2026? Gu Pungs complexion changed and he checked his surroundings. He was able to see Jang Hong and Jang Seo Eun but he wasnt able to see Ju Seo Cheon. He checked thoroughly as he may be hanging on another rock but he couldnt even see a hair. Seung Kye! Next to him, the voice of the anxious Zhuge Sang was heard. His eyes were also rolling busily and his complexion wasnt good either. Seung Kye, answer me if you are near! Seung Kye! Zhuge Sangs heart breaking voice rang out. This cant be\u2026 Gu Pung couldnt believe it. Ju Seo Cheon and Zhuge Seung Kye. Only those two were nowhere to be seen.","title":"Vocanic Age Chapter 33"},{"location":"volcanic-34/","text":"Vocanic Age Chapter 34 Three weeks later. Guizhou, Weng An. Hahaha! Good! Good! Really good! Lee Ui Chae danced and laughed out loud. He liked the weight of the pocket he was holding. Lee Ui Chae was certainly a merchant that was great enough to be called as the Merchant King in the future. He displayed his talents for doing business without regrets and earned money. He hit the mark on the distribution of the products, the period, etc. He bought good quality products for the cheapest price possible and sold them at a reasonable price. Even though it may seem simple to do that, it wasnt something anyone could do. The Merchant King was just too good in this. Even the branch manager of Kae An, Shin Do Gyun, started to gain interest in his skills and he also gave him a commission not long ago. It has been three weeks since he started doing business in Weng An and he had already spread to Kae An. The entire Guizhou didnt seem to be far away. Aside from that, he also earned money through other methods. The Golden Merchant Organization didnt only provide provisions but also weapons. It wasnt at an impressive level yet, they mostly picked up the weapons that were thrown away in the battlefield and sold them to the smithies of Chongqing. After buying low ranked equipment from the smithies in Chongqing, they went out to the front lines to sell them to the warriors or ronins. There were times when greedy ronins or vulgar fellows from nearby factions aimed for them but they calmly gave up on the idea when they heard that the organization was connected to the branch of Weng An and to Shin Do Gyun. The only ones that could touch the Golden Merchant Organization in Guizhou was the River of Death, which opposed the Murim Association. Huhihi! Its money, money! Lee Ui Chae laughed in a weird way and jumped in joy. Money and especially gold filled up his heart. He enjoyed counting money more than embracing women. Honestly speaking, Lee Ui Chae didnt understand why people fell for alcohol and women. Smelling or touching is enough with money. Huhu, these guys\u2026im dying, dying. Lee Ui Chae rubbed his face on a mountain of silver coins with enchanted eyes. It hurt a bit but even that turned into a pleasant feeling. Buhihi, hihihi\u2026 It was madness that even the Blood Sect and the Demonic Sect would get tired of. Ah, I am greatly indebted to great Master Ju. If it wasnt for him, I would still be licking someones butt. Lee Ui Chae removed his face from the mountain of silver coins. I want to pay back that debt but what can I do if hes not in this world anymore? What should I do young noble Ju? He started to speak with less honorifics. Young noble Ju, have an easy passage into eternity. I will send you silver coins for\u2026no, silver coins are a bit too much. Hes someone that doesnt exist in this world anyways. Then, three pennies? Two pennies? No\u2026even a single penny is too much. How will a dead person use money? Lets just send him my feelings. Lee Ui Chae clasped his hands and bowed. Ju. . what was it? I dont even remember his name. Lee Ui Chae completely forgot about the Ju whatever it was. Knock knock. Who is it? Lee Ui Chae cleaned up the silver coins and asked. Head merchant, a martial artist says that he wants to meet you. A warrior that was guarding the door replied. Does he look like he has a lot of money? He looks penniless. Did he say that he belongs to one of the Nine Factions, the Five Segas or the Murim Association? He says hes a ronin. Is he famous? Hes not. Chase him out! It would have been different before but right now, he didnt have time to spend on that kind of person. It was much better to find something that was more profitable at that time. Yes. The conversation ended. Lee Ui Chae took out the gold coins this time and started to count them. His lips curled up to the point it made people looking at it feel bad. Knock knock. Agh, what now! Lee Ui Chae stood up from his seat. May I enter? A voice was heard from outside the door but the voice belonged to someone besides the warrior that spoke just now. Yes, come in! It was a familiar voice. He wondered if he was a guard that belonged to a branch of his organization. Creeeeak. The door entered and a kid that looked like he had just come of age entered the room. Uagh! Lee Ui Chae screamed and fell back. Yo, you, you are! Lee Ui Chae pointed at the man with trembling fingers. You dont look well, head merchant. Are you ready to raid the treasury? Huaaak! Its a ghost! Its undoubtedly a ghost! Lee Ui Chae embraced the money pockets and curled down. Dont go killing people as you wish, head merchant. Ju Seo Cheon smirked and turned to look back. Come in. What about the warrior that passed out? A kid that seemed to be nine or ten years old followed behind Ju Seo Cheon. He was a kid that looked weaker than kids his age. Dont tell me\u2026 Lee Ui Chaes eyes trembled when he saw the kid. Hes Zhuge Seung Kye. Do you know about him? There are two ghosts! Fall back! I cant give you a single penny to you! Lee Ui Chae was horrified and started to scream. Is there no one there! You are noisy, head merchant. Ju Seo Cheon slammed the wall with his fist and a small hole appeared with a loud noise. I didnt die yet and Im right in front of you right now so please be quiet. Theres something I want to talk about. Lee Ui Chae raised his head slightly and confirmed the hole in the wall. And then, he stood up immediately and acted in a cringy way as if what he had shown until now was all a lie. Murim said that the Great Master had died but I didnt once doubt that you would be alive, Great Master! Lee Ui Chae was really shameless. One news striked hard on Murim about three weeks ago. The death of a Hundred Expert, the Slipping Water Spearman Yook Dae Rang. And that the one that killed him was the Fourteenth Gallant Sword, Gu Pung. Experts always attracted the attention of Murim and it also became a topic. What happened that day spread like rumors in no time. But why did you fight? Dont those pirates request for toll fees when you cross the Yangtze River? It seems like the kids of Mount Hua and the Zhuge Sega couldnt endure their anger and striked first. Ho, certainly the future of the Nine Factions and the Five Segas. Mm, right. They are indeed martial artists of the Righteous Faction. It turned out well. The Nine Fleets of the Water Forest were called as chivalrous robbers and guardians but that was all nonsense. In the end, they were a group of bandits that stole others possessions. It wasnt only people of Murim, but even normal citizens felt refreshed when they heard those news. But the kids that could be called the future lost their lives. Thats unfortunate. Ju Seo Cheon and Zhuge Seung Kye were treated as missing. Because of that, the Murim of the Righteous Faction was in an uproar. One of them was a member of the pride of Mount Hua, the Lotus Peak and the other one was a nephew of the family that led the Zhuge Sega. Mount Hua and the Zhuge Sega, which were the victims here, were so enraged they almost invaded their enemies. Do you know everything up to this point? Lee Ui Chae stopped speaking and wet his throat with tea. Yes, I somewhat heard it through the rumors but I dont know what happened after that. Indeed. Lee Ui Chae nodded and continued speaking. Before Mount Hua and the Zhuge Sega could even inquire anything, the Nine Fleets of the Water Forest justified themselves saying that it was self-defense. Thats a lie. That never happened. Most people should already know. That is because the death of Great Master brought great repercussions, especially here in Weng An. They also heard about the details of what happened. However, Mount Hua and Zhuge Sega didnt deny that argument as the rumors had spread as much as it could. It wasnt only in Kang Ho but most people in the Midlands thought that the group of Mount Hua and the Zhuge Sega couldnt endure the injustice of the Nine Fleets of the Water Forest and attacked first. And they were actually being praised for that. However, the position of Mount Hua and the Zhuge Sega would become vague if they denied that. It could also mean as having stayed silent and allowed the injustice being done by the pirates. If that happened, they would get criticized so they werent able to deny the rumors. Even if Ju Seo Cheons and Zhuge Seung Kyes identities werent ordinary, they werent at a level where they would consider to brave a controversy and avenge them. In the end, no one could give out an opinion about the matter and it ended like this. Great Master should also know this but Mount Hua and the Zhuge Sega arent able to move as they wish because of the other forces of Murim. The damages they would suffer if they fought against the Nine Fleets of the Water Forest head on wasnt normal. That would be a shattering in the balance of the forces. What came after that would be war aiming at the weakened Righteous Faction. However, Great Master Ju and young Master Zhuge have returned in the middle of that. Just what happened? Lee Ui Chae looked at the faces of the two people like he still couldnt believe it. We were separated from the group and were washed away to a farther place by the Yangtze River. We almost reached Hubei like that. It was hard taking care of Zhuge Seung Kye, who had lost consciousness, when he had also suffered injuries but fortunately he managed to survive. We went south from Hubei to Hunan and then returned here to Guizhou. Thats why it took some time. No, why did you return? Hubei is the territory of the Righteous Faction and on top of that\u2026isnt the Zhuge Sega over there? Thats why. Ju Seo Cheon put on a vague smile and spoke before Lee Ui Chae could say anything. They would make a fuss if Seung Kye or I get discovered and each of us will have to return to Mount Hua and the Zhuge Sega and get protected. If that happens we wouldnt be able to come out for a few years. Then, we just have to give up on the treasury of the Three Eyed Immoral God. Ah\u2026. ! Lee Ui Chae let out an exclamation. However\u2026ah, its nothing. The treasury wouldnt run away but it may get raided by someone else if he delayed anymore. \u2018The treasury may really exist if I looking at the lengths he is willing to go to. He had heard of it about three weeks, no, a month ago but he was still not fully convinced. Precisely speaking, he didnt think anything about it. He had unconsciously taken care of things to obtain the commercializing rights of the provisions for the army. But today, his thoughts changed when he saw how Ju Seo Cheon came to find him while keeping it a secret from others. The reason you brought young Master Zhuge is to take a secret mission? Indeed, Great Master is really thorough. You got a person and even prepared thoroughly for the plan\u2026As expected of the Great Master. Lee Ui Chae rubbed his palms and made an obvious flattery. Thats not the case. Seung Kye is a business associate. It will be impossible to raid the treasury without him. Ju Seo Cheon started to speak about the mechanisms that were installed in the treasury. Are you certain the treasury exists? Zhuge Seung Kye put on a doubtful face from the side. Whether it is certain or not, you should just follow me. Little brother, you wouldnt betray your life savior right? Ugh. It seemed like Zhuge Seung Kye had something to say but he shut his mouth. Ju Seo Cheon had made Zhuge Seung Kye follow him under the pretense that he was his savior. Zhuge Seung Kye really disliked that but the debt still lingered on his mind so he still followed Ju Seo Cheon even though he was obviously dissatisfied. Now, head merchant. Are you ready for it? Ju Seo Cheon smiled faintly. I will follow you Great Master!","title":"volcanic-34"},{"location":"volcanic-34/#vocanic-age-chapter-34","text":"Three weeks later. Guizhou, Weng An. Hahaha! Good! Good!

I couldnt fulfill my responsibilities as the guardian of the Lotus Peak. Because of you, your disciple got sacrificed\u2026im really sorry. Gu Pungs voice was filled with guilt. He wasnt even able to raise his head properly. About three weeks ago, he won against Yook Dae Rang miraculously and survived but he wasnt able to save Ju Seo Cheon. He reported it to Mount Hua and patrolled for a few days with the warriors of the Murim Association but they couldnt find him. They wanted to look for them for a little bit longer but an urgent order to return was sent so he had to take the members of the Lotus Peak and return to Mount Hua. He had continued searching without stopping but he wasnt able to get a clue and returned not long ago. In reality, it was no different from having come to a conclusion that he was dead. Its all my fault. If I had believed in your disciple even a little, things wouldnt have turned like this. In addition, Ju Seo Cheons evaluation was completely overturned. There was no one that called him the flashy yet frail one anymore. Everyone was surprised by Ju Seo Cheons performance. They got amazed at his attitude of not minding the disdain from his surroundings at all working hard on learning more, all the while hiding his strength and skills. Thats why it was all the more regrettable. They couldnt stop lamenting having lost that kind of genius. \u2013 Yu Jong Mong had been in Kang Ho for a long time since he became a pinnacle expert. But one day, he heard news about Ju Seo Cheon and returned hurriedly to Mount Hua, and that day was today. Gu Pung, that was staying in Mount Hua, heard notices about Yu Jong Mok returning and went to find him first to bow. I would like to go to the Nine Fleets of the Water Forest and get revenge but\u2026 He wasnt able to move because of his situation. Even the Murim Alliance was investigating this matter. There was no way Yook Dae Rang would suddenly ambush the members of the Lotus Peak and the direct descendants of the Zhuge Family if he hadnt turned insane. On top of that, based on the information they had it was said that the ships were regulated on purpose in case the group crossed the Yangtze River in small groups. They were doubting that there may be something behind it as it was a systematic ambush. Even though I dont have a disciple, that doesnt mean that I dont know what sadness, rage and pain that comes when losing a disciple means. It doesnt matter for me so please, resent and despise me. The masters were like parents for their disciples, and that meant that the disciples were like children for the masters. Although they shared no blood at all, they were connected by love and a connection that was beyond that. I wont ever\u2026. Yu Jong Mok wasnt listening silently since before. He had tried to calm him down but Gu Pung only repeated similar words and continued to apologize. It seemed like he was yelling him to kill him. Senior brother. In the end, Yu Jong Mok had to interrupt Gu Pung inevitably. Yes. Gu Pung put on a determined face. But the words that came out from Yu Jong Mok were complety different to what he was waiting. Im fine so dont be like that. Fellow brother. Acting like that is harder for me. Yu Jong Mok smiled bitterly and his eyes seemed somewhat complicated. It hasnt been long since I returned to Mount Hua from Kang Ho. It seems like my body and mind are a bit tired that I need some time alone. I guess thats why I could feel all those gazes on me. \u2026. Im sorry. I wasnt thinking straight. Gu Pung apologized once again with a dark expression. Yu Jong Mok couldnt even remember how many times he had apologized. So can you leave me alone for the moment? Right, I understand. Im really sorry for not having been considerate. Have some rest. Gu Pung left. His two shoulders were weighing with guilt. Yu Jong Mok confirmed that Gu Pung had left and let out a sigh. Seo Cheon, you were much more amazing than what this master of yours thought. He raised his right hand and checked his bosom. A folded letter came out from it. Yu Jong Mok received a letter when rumors about his disciple spread and it reached the branch of the Murim Association he was at. The disciple, that was known to be dead, was the sender. The contents written in the letter was too long. But if you were to summarize it was that he was safe but was asking his master to keep it a secret. That he was sorry to have made him worry and that he would certainly return with Zhuge Seung Kye. Im worried about you so dont be too late. Yu Jong Mok raised his head and looked at the sky. It was a clear weather with no clouds at all. Weng An, the Golden Business Organization. Lee Ui Chae ended up buying a house in Weng An as he mostly active there. The prices of the houses in Weng An were so cheap it made you doubt about it but it wasnt weird at all if you thought about the characteristics of Weng An. People that looked like martial artists were gathered in front of the courtyard. There were ten of them and Ju Seo Cheon had checked them when he entered. Nine were second rate and only one of them was first rate, that was close to reach the peak. Its fine if their abilities arent that good. The most important thing is trust. It doesnt matter about the treasury because it will get known later but the group has to be composed by people that wont escape with the treasures. You dont have to worry if its that. Lee Ui Chae put on a reliable smile. You arent going to say something like they are reliable because they are your blood relatives, right? If that is the case, then I will have to decline. This is a world where even siblings kill each other for treasures. Im not such a naive person, great master. Lee Ui Chae spoke telling him not to worry. The people that are outside are all people that treasure their own families. Also, theres a person each in their families that they have to support. You didnt take their families as hostages, right? Zhuge Seung Kye frowned and asked. Oh my, young noble Zhuge. Im not such an evil person. Lee Ui Chae shook his hands. I made a deal with them. That if they were loyal to me, I would treat and heal their families for free. There are times when people did anything for their treasured people and Lee Ui Chae used that love. I only searched for people that wont be able to hold a few days without my assistance. Also, I also investigated about their character beforehand. Shouldnt we also consider a situation where they escape with their families after they obtain some treasures? Hohoho! \u2018What should I call this? Ju Seo Cheon got astounded. It wasnt a threat but if you thought about it well, it was no different from a threat. It was a situation where you could think of it like \u2018I may kill your family if you betray me. But it was also vague to say that he was evil In the first place, they were unrelated to each other. Lee Ui Chae had no sense of duty to take care of their families by spending a lot of money for it. Lee Ui Chae had only offered a deal, not a threat and the ones that accepted were themselves. \u2018His ability on dealing with people is ghostlike, just like the rumors said. Being outstanding in business meant that he was also good at negotiating. The Merchant King noticed the intentions of the people like a ghost and knew exactly what they wanted. And he utilized that to get the most of the profit. The subjects for that didnt differentiate between forces such as the Righteous Faction, Demonic Faction, Death Sect or the Blood Sect. It wasnt for show that he stayed alive until the age of war ended. \u2018Thats why he is also a scary person. Lee Ui Chae understood the emotions of the people better than anyone else. He had to understand them to use that as a means to earn money. There were no emotions in his understanding. There was no disdain, scorn, rage or sympathy at all. He was simply using them as a means to earn money. I already told the warriors that they would be raiding a tomb. How did you introduce me to them? I said that you were an expert whose words had to be followed with no complaints. They are people that dont know your face or young nobles Zhuge so you dont have to worry about that. Well done. The treasury is in Chongqing. The exact location is here, so sent people to a nearby village. We need means to contact you quickly when we return. Ju Seo Cheon handed out a coded map. And this is a decodification method. Memorize it all and burn it down. Ohh, as expected of the great master! Knowledge that can even slap on the honor of Zhuge Liang! You are really omniscient! Lee Ui Chae got impressed in an exaggerated manner and hit his forehead with his palm. Kya! This small merchant got so impressed that tears are about to fall. Cry then. Men shouldnt shed tears easily. Lee Ui Chae handed out a pocket that contained travel expenses. I will be assisting your trip from a side and from somewhere they cant see me. Raid up to the heart of the treasury. But of course, you know that treasures are more important than bones right? Head merchant, wipe your drool first. Hut! I made a mistake. Lets meet again later, then. I hope you have a safe trip. Ju Seo Cheon took Zhuge Seung Kye and the ten warriors Lee Ui Chae gave him and left to Chongqing. Chongqing was filled with martial artists of the Righteous Faction to search for Ju Seo Cheon and Zhuge Seung Kye but that wasnt the case now. They couldnt even see any pirates. It was because the Eighteen Strongholds of the Monsoon Rain had given out an order to be prudent on plundering for the moment. They want us to believe in that kid that has just started to grow pubic hair? The warriors got dumbfounded when they first saw Ju Seo Cheon, before their expedition began. It was because the expert the head merchant had introduced was a youth that had just come of age. In the Midlands, one became an adult at fifteen years old. That meant that he wasnt even a youth. If they had known that Ju Seo Cheon was actually only twelve, they may have convulsed. Sh, shout your mouths. It seems like he really is an expert. The only first rate warrior among the ten of them raised his index finger and placed it on his lips. He was telling them to shut up. Experts recognized low ranks but contrary to that, low ranks couldnt recognize an expert. Is that true brother Wang? Brother Wang was the first rate warrior, Wang il. The name Wang il was a old fashioned but he was still a first rate warrior that almost reached the peak. He was someone that had grown up to that boundary from the pit so he was that respected and also had many people following him. Is he really a martial artist? Normal people didnt learn martial arts and thats why there was no rank. It was obvious for them to not recognize it. You must have also seen clearly the steps of captain Ju or his posture with no openings. Mm. Dont look away because of your pride. And even if he is not an expert, we must obey his orders. Didnt the head merchant say so before leaving Weng An? Im sorry brother Wang. Theres no need to apologize to me. Apologize to captain Ju when we are resting later. The head merchant may see us in a bad light if we make a mistake.","title":"volcanic-35"},{"location":"volcanic-35/#vocanic-age-chapter-35","text":"Shaanxi, Mount Hua. Dont forgive me! Gu Pung bowed his head so low, it almost touched the ground. Senior brother\u2026 Yu Jong Mok had a troubled expression. Even if the both of them were third generation disciples, Gu Pung was the best of their generation. Receiving an apology like this would only make Yu Jong Mok troubled. I couldnt fulfill my responsibilities as the guardian of the Lotus Peak. Because of you, your disciple got sacrificed\u2026im really sorry. Gu Pungs voice was filled with guilt. He wasnt even able to raise his head properly. About three weeks ago, he won against Yook Dae Rang miraculously and survived but he wasnt able to save Ju Seo Cheon.

There was a region called the Secret Burial Grounds in the west. It was a place that especially had a lot of rocks like limestones and sandstones. Ju Seo Cheons group entered the Secret Burial Grounds. What did you say was here? Wang il asked. It was impossible to farm or cut wood near the Secret Burial. There were only rocks in that place but that didnt mean there were mines with steel ores in it. The only things were the rocks that were spread on the low hills. You couldnt even find plants so it was no different from being a land of death. The last time they had rested was three days ago, in a nearby village. The group was as exhausted as they could be. Ju Seo Cheon entered a deep place inside the Secret Burial Grounds that showed no signs of humans having been there. The treasure trove. A thick smile formed in Ju Seo Cheons face. His shining eyes were looking at the rocks that were stuck together. Huh\u2026? Zhuge Seung Kye raised his head and checked the rocks. His eyes were filled with suspicions. This is\u2026. Oh, brother. Do you know what it is? Ju Seo Cheon rejoiced and asked. No, I cant explain it in words but\u2026mm, right. Lets see. This place seems a bit weird. Zhuge Seung Kye stepped out actively. That wasnt like him. He touched a part of the boulder. His eyes shone in an investigative light. Do what you want. Ju Seo Cheon sat on a random rock. It didnt seem like he would stand up anytime soon looking at the way he had sat down. \u2018Whew, hes not the best genius regarding the Arts of Machinery. We wouldnt have been able to find even the entrance if I hadnt taken Seung Kye with us. He had wandered a bit but he was unable to find the location of the treasury successfully with just the help of his memories. But when he arrived at this place, he noticed that there was something different from his memories. It was the existence of an entrance. In his past life, the entrance had already been opened because it was discovered beforehand but there was nothing today. He was honestly so flustered that no words came out from his mouth. Click. Uh, this is it. Something made a sound while he was in the middle of touching the rocks. Kugugugung! After that, a loud sound was heard and the ground shook. At first, they got the impression that the sky was collapsing. Wh, what is it! The warriors were astonished. Even Wang il, who could be called a seasoned veteran, showed bewilderment. Ho, was that the case? So they made it like this. Impressive indeed. The surroundings shook at the tremor. Zhuge Seung Kye lost his balance and fell on the ground but it didnt seem like he was scared. Contrary to that, he checked his surroundings with curious eyes and mumbled. He was usually a scaredy cat but showed this personality on things related to the Arts of Machinery. \u2018Finally! How long had he waited for this moment! After he returned in time, he thought about the treasury and set up a plan. He prepared several times, thought and modified his plans. And that hard work finally paid off. He understood how explorers felt after he became the first discoverer that would be recorded down in history for this important event. Im sorry. Originally, there was another owner for this view. And Ju Seo Cheon apologized to that unknown person. Umm. Wang il exclaimed. After about ten minutes passed, and the stairs that connected underground appeared in front of the group. Just what\u2026 Wang il mumbled. We arrived at our destination. Ju Seo Cheon lifted Zhuge Seung Kye, who was still on the floor and mumbling, A, a tomb with a mechanism like this installed\u2026just who is asleep in here? Treasures. Ju Seo Cheons eyes curved like a crescent moon. Fwoosh. Torches lit up. What appeared before them when they descended the stairs was a room that could accommodate a hundred people. There was a writing with three eyes written on the floor. Dont tell me\u2026 Wang il saw the writing and thought of something. No, it wasnt only him. All the other warriors thought the same thing. This is a writing of the Three Eyed Immoral God! Zhuge Seung Kye was the first one who yelled in a surprised voice. The Three Eyed Immoral God was such an outstanding legendary thief that there was no one that didnt know about him. It was the same for five or six year old kids. No, that is impossible. There was a guess in his head but it was too unreliable so he shook his head immediately and denied it. Hey, captain. It was a thick voice that didnt belong to a man, but to a woman. She was the only female among the ten warriors. However, her physique was bigger than the average men and her well trained and swelled muscles boasted of a perfect beauty. There was a long vertical scar on her mouth and her eyes were quite sharp. You couldnt say that she was the pretty type, and in the first place she was a middle aged woman that couldnt be seen as a love partner. Whats wrong Cho Ryeon? Ju Seo Cheon replied while checking his surroundings thoroughly. Speak honestly. Whose tomb is this? Cho Ryeons face was really stiff. According to my information, this isnt a tomb but a treasury. At least, the corpse of the Three Eyed Immoral God wasnt discovered in his past life. So, whose? Cho Ryeon asked as if it was frustrating. The Three Eyed Immoral God Ju Seo Cheon answered without hesitating at all. Impossible! Zhuge Seung Kye jumped up. Th, this place is the treasury of that legendary thief? That was only a baseless rumor! No one knew what happened after the The Three Eyed Immoral God died. Thats why people spoke more about the treasures he left behind. There was no way the treasures stolen by a thief that represented almost an entire era, disappeared. They thought that those treasures would certainly be hidden somewhere. And there was also an investigation by the government. But in the end, only the rumors became denser and the treasures didnt get discovered. The government, Murim and even tomb raiders stepped forward but they couldnt find a single clue. That was how the treasury was forgotten over time. We will know that when we enter. Ju Seo Cheon said while still looking in front. There were a total of eight passages spreading like roots from the center of the room. They all looked identical to each other so you couldnt differentiate them. On top of that, the passages were pitch black so you couldnt see what was in it. Someone wants to return? Ju Seo Cheon turned back and asked the opinion of the group but no one answered. They all came here due to their own private circumstances. I dont know if its real but\u2026 I dont think we will be able to turn around after we advance, what should we do? Cho Ryeon asked Wang il. It meant that she was that uneasy. What do you mean\u2026we have to follow Captain even if it means our death. I will work hard so that you dont die but I promise you that I will take responsibility for your families even if that does happen. Ju Seo Cheon added some words right after Wang il. Whew. Someone sighed in relief at those words. It seemed like they couldnt do anything about it. Just give the order, Captain. I will take the lead, and you protect Seung from all sides. However, dont block his view. Even if he looks like this, he is the most important one among us. Seung was the fake name Zhuge Seung Kye would be using temporarily. How so? This treasury itself has so many mechanisms it could be seen as a single mechanism. The only one that can recognize it and disarm it is the person standing there. This kid? Cho Ryeon looked down at Zhuge Seung Kye with a suspicious look. Ahem. Zhuge Seung Kye spread his chest and acted pridefully. He had a negative way of thinking about every circumstance but he showed quite the confident look about things related to the Arts of Machinery. It doesnt matter if you dont believe me but you can do that if you want to see everyone in here die after leaving him behind. \u2026Tch. Cho Ryeon clicked her tongue. In addition, I said that I would be taking the lead but we will prioritize Seungs words rather than mine. You should follow what he says even if our opinions differ. At least, hes more of an expert than the people gathered here. I dont feel that relieved when thinking that all of our lives rely on a kid that isnt even ten yet. Wang il sighed. The group made the final inspection before entering the passageways. Which path should we take? Ju Seo Cheon asked Zhuge Seung Kye. Um, it doesnt seem that different? Zhuge Seung Kye scratched his head. Right, then\u2026lets go over there. He walked towards the third passageway from the left. Ah, wait. Zhuge Seung Kye stopped Ju Seo Cheon. When Ju Seo Cheon asked what was wrong, Zhuge Seung Kye picked a pebble that was on the floor and threw it towards the entrance. Chechechecheng! The moment the pebble passed the entrance, spears fell down from the ceiling and stabbed the ground. \u2026You said that there was no difference? Ju Seo Cheon asked in a dumbfounded way. Right. All of them have that installed. Zhuge Seung Kye blinked as if asking what was the problem. Im going crazy. Wang il gulped saliva. His complexion was plae. After that\u2026theres nothing else, right? Yes. Haa. We should take care of those spears first. The group pulled out the spears blocking the entrance. There were about a hundred spears. They were able to enter the passageway after that. How did Young Master Seung notice that? If possible, can you teach me how you did it? Wang il asked Zhuge Seung Kye politely. Its pointless to ask him. Ju Seo Cheon smirked and laughed out loud. Ah, I made a mistake. Wang il thought that the Arts of Machinery was a kind of martial arts for Zhuge Seung Kye. He quickly apologized as he thought that he was asking something like the secrets of a martial art. No, thats not what I meant. Ju Seo Cheon shook his head lightly. Hey Seung, can you teach us how you did it? Ju Seo Cheon stopped for a moment and looked at Zhuge Seung Kye. Why cant you see something this easy to notice? Zhuge Seung Kye tilted his head as if he couldnt understand. Um\u2026its hard to explain, you can just see it right. Like saying that there will be a trap installed over there. The warriors and Wang il included fell in silence. What a kid. Hes full of himself. Cho Ryeon mumbled. I agree. Ju Seo Cheon also agreed. There was a time that he had asked some simple things to Zhuge Seung Kye to learn about them. But Zhuge Seung Kye always tilted his head and spoke strange words like now. Borrowing Zhuge Seung Kyes words, you just had to touch the part that seemed awkward to disarm it. He was really a genius, and the type he hated the most. But hes that reliable. There were dozens of types of traps installed in the passageway. Not even an hour had passed, but the number of traps that got activated or that they disarmed was so much they had to give up on counting it. They would have died already if it wasnt for him. The group members that were half in doubt at Ju Seo Cheons words realized the importance of Zhuge Seung Kye and got serious on guarding him. And after another hour passed. The passageway started to widen and dolls appeared. But there werent one or two of them. The group raised their torches to check what it was and said something strance. Wooden dolls?","title":"volcanic-36"},{"location":"volcanic-36/#vocanic-age-chapter-36","text":"Most of the territory of Chongqing was formed by low hills made by limestones and sandstones, except for the Central Region which was connected by the Yangtze River.

Ju Seo Cheon entered a deep place inside the Secret Burial Grounds that showed no signs of humans having been there. The treasure trove. A thick smile formed in Ju Seo Cheons face. His shining eyes were looking at the rocks that were stuck together. Huh\u2026? Zhuge Seung Kye raised his head and checked the rocks. His eyes were filled with suspicions. This is\u2026. Oh, brother. Do you know what it is? Ju Seo Cheon rejoiced and asked. No, I cant explain it in words but\u2026mm, right. Lets see. This place seems a bit weird. Zhuge Seung Kye stepped out actively. That wasnt like him. He touched a part of the boulder. His eyes shone in an investigative light. Do what you want. Ju Seo Cheon sat on a random rock. It didnt seem like he would stand up anytime soon looking at the way he had sat down. \u2018Whew, hes not the best genius regarding the Arts of Machinery. We wouldnt have been able to find even the entrance if I hadnt taken Seung Kye with us. He had wandered a bit but he was unable to find the location of the treasury successfully with just the help of his memories. But when he arrived at this place, he noticed that there was something different from his memories. It was the existence of an entrance. In his past life, the entrance had already been opened because it was discovered beforehand but there was nothing today. He was honestly so flustered that no words came out from his mouth. Click. Uh, this is it. Something made a sound while he was in the middle of touching the rocks. Kugugugung! After that, a loud sound was heard and the ground shook. At first, they got the impression that the sky was collapsing. Wh, what is it! The warriors were astonished. Even Wang il, who could be called a seasoned veteran, showed bewilderment. Ho, was that the case? So they made it like this. Impressive indeed. The surroundings shook at the tremor. Zhuge Seung Kye lost his balance and fell on the ground but it didnt seem like he was scared. Contrary to that, he checked his surroundings with curious eyes and mumbled. He was usually a scaredy cat but showed this personality on things related to the Arts of Machinery. \u2018Finally! How long had he waited for this moment! After he returned in time, he thought about the treasury and set up a plan. He prepared several times, thought and modified his plans. And that hard work finally paid off. He understood how explorers felt after he became the first discoverer that would be recorded down in history for this important event. Im sorry. Originally, there was another owner for this view. And Ju Seo Cheon apologized to that unknown person. Umm. Wang il exclaimed. After about ten minutes passed, and the stairs that connected underground appeared in front of the group. Just what\u2026 Wang il mumbled. We arrived at our destination. Ju Seo Cheon lifted Zhuge Seung Kye, who was still on the floor and mumbling, A, a tomb with a mechanism like this installed\u2026just who is asleep in here? Treasures. Ju Seo Cheons eyes curved like a crescent moon. Fwoosh. Torches lit up. What appeared before them when they descended the stairs was a room that could accommodate a hundred people. There was a writing with three eyes written on the floor. Dont tell me\u2026 Wang il saw the writing and thought of something. No, it wasnt only him. All the other warriors thought the same thing. This is a writing of the Three Eyed Immoral God! Zhuge Seung Kye was the first one who yelled in a surprised voice. The Three Eyed Immoral God was such an outstanding legendary thief that there was no one that didnt know about him. It was the same for five or six year old kids. No, that is impossible. There was a guess in his head but it was too unreliable so he shook his head immediately and denied it. Hey, captain. It was a thick voice that didnt belong to a man, but to a woman. She was the only female among the ten warriors. However, her physique was bigger than the average men and her well trained and swelled muscles boasted of a perfect beauty. There was a long vertical scar on her mouth and her eyes were quite sharp. You couldnt say that she was the pretty type, and in the first place she was a middle aged woman that couldnt be seen as a love partner. Whats wrong Cho Ryeon? Ju Seo Cheon replied while checking his surroundings thoroughly. Speak honestly. Whose tomb is this? Cho Ryeons face was really stiff. According to my information, this isnt a tomb but a treasury. At least, the corpse of the Three Eyed Immoral God wasnt discovered in his past life. So, whose? Cho Ryeon asked as if it was frustrating. The Three Eyed Immoral God Ju Seo Cheon answered without hesitating at all. Impossible! Zhuge Seung Kye jumped up. Th, this place is the treasury of that legendary thief? That was only a baseless rumor! No one knew what happened after the The Three Eyed Immoral God died. Thats why people spoke more about the treasures he left behind. There was no way the treasures stolen by a thief that represented almost an entire era, disappeared. They thought that those treasures would certainly be hidden somewhere. And there was also an investigation by the government. But in the end, only the rumors became denser and the treasures didnt get discovered. The government, Murim and even tomb raiders stepped forward but they couldnt find a single clue. That was how the treasury was forgotten over time. We will know that when we enter. Ju Seo Cheon said while still looking in front. There were a total of eight passages spreading like roots from the center of the room. They all looked identical to each other so you couldnt differentiate them. On top of that, the passages were pitch black so you couldnt see what was in it. Someone wants to return? Ju Seo Cheon turned back and asked the opinion of the group but no one answered. They all came here due to their own private circumstances. I dont know if its real but\u2026 I dont think we will be able to turn around after we advance, what should we do? Cho Ryeon asked Wang il. It meant that she was that uneasy. What do you mean\u2026we have to follow Captain even if it means our death. I will work hard so that you dont die but I promise you that I will take responsibility for your families even if that does happen. Ju Seo Cheon added some words right after Wang il. Whew. Someone sighed in relief at those words. It seemed like they couldnt do anything about it. Just give the order, Captain. I will take the lead, and you protect Seung from all sides. However, dont block his view. Even if he looks like this, he is the most important one among us. Seung was the fake name Zhuge Seung Kye would be using temporarily. How so? This treasury itself has so many mechanisms it could be seen as a single mechanism. The only one that can recognize it and disarm it is the person standing there. This kid? Cho Ryeon looked down at Zhuge Seung Kye with a suspicious look. Ahem. Zhuge Seung Kye spread his chest and acted pridefully. He had a negative way of thinking about every circumstance but he showed quite the confident look about things related to the Arts of Machinery. It doesnt matter if you dont believe me but you can do that if you want to see everyone in here die after leaving him behind. \u2026Tch. Cho Ryeon clicked her tongue. In addition, I said that I would be taking the lead but we will prioritize Seungs words rather than mine. You should follow what he says even if our opinions differ. At least, hes more of an expert than the people gathered here. I dont feel that relieved when thinking that all of our lives rely on a kid that isnt even ten yet. Wang il sighed. The group made the final inspection before entering the passageways. Which path should we take? Ju Seo Cheon asked Zhuge Seung Kye. Um, it doesnt seem that different? Zhuge Seung Kye scratched his head. Right, then\u2026lets go over there. He walked towards the third passageway from the left. Ah, wait. Zhuge Seung Kye stopped Ju Seo Cheon. When Ju Seo Cheon asked what was wrong, Zhuge Seung Kye picked a pebble that was on the floor and threw it towards the entrance. Chechechecheng! The moment the pebble passed the entrance, spears fell down from the ceiling and stabbed the ground. \u2026You said that there was no difference? Ju Seo Cheon asked in a dumbfounded way. Right. All of them have that installed. Zhuge Seung Kye blinked as if asking what was the problem. Im going crazy. Wang il gulped saliva. His complexion was plae. After that\u2026theres nothing else, right? Yes. Haa. We should take care of those spears first. The group pulled out the spears blocking the entrance. There were about a hundred spears. They were able to enter the passageway after that. How did Young Master Seung notice that? If possible, can you teach me how you did it? Wang il asked Zhuge Seung Kye politely. Its pointless to ask him. Ju Seo Cheon smirked and laughed out loud. Ah, I made a mistake. Wang il thought that the Arts of Machinery was a kind of martial arts for Zhuge Seung Kye. He quickly apologized as he thought that he was asking something like the secrets of a martial art. No, thats not what I meant. Ju Seo Cheon shook his head lightly. Hey Seung, can you teach us how you did it? Ju Seo Cheon stopped for a moment and looked at Zhuge Seung Kye. Why cant you see something this easy to notice? Zhuge Seung Kye tilted his head as if he couldnt understand. Um\u2026its hard to explain, you can just see it right. Like saying that there will be a trap installed over there. The warriors and Wang il included fell in silence. What a kid. Hes full of himself. Cho Ryeon mumbled. I agree. Ju Seo Cheon also agreed. There was a time that he had asked some simple things to Zhuge Seung Kye to learn about them. But Zhuge Seung Kye always tilted his head and spoke strange words like now. Borrowing Zhuge Seung Kyes words, you just had to touch the part that seemed awkward to disarm it. He was really a genius, and the type he hated the most. But hes that reliable. There were dozens of types of traps installed in the passageway. Not even an hour had passed, but the number of traps that got activated or that they disarmed was so much they had to give up on counting it. They would have died already if it wasnt for him. The group members that were half in doubt at Ju Seo Cheons words realized the importance of Zhuge Seung Kye and got serious on guarding him. And after another hour passed. The passageway started to widen and dolls appeared. But there werent one or two of them. The group raised their torches to check what it was and said something strance. Wooden dolls?","title":"Vocanic Age Chapter 36"},{"location":"volcanic-37/","text":"Vocanic Age Chapter 37 About thirty wooden dolls were standing on both sides of the wall. And all of them were motionless. Why are wooden dolls here? One of the warriors spoke. Wooden dolls were familiar for the warriors. It was because they trained their martial arts with them when they were young. They swung their swords or their fists to grasp the location of the organs. Besides that, they also took out wooden dolls that were accumulating dust in the storage when they needed an opponent but had no one. That is also a mechanism device. Zhuge Seung Kye checked out the ceiling, floor and walls and then finally at the wooden dolls. What kind of mechanism? Ju Seo Cheon asked. I dont know either as I havent seen it before. Zhuge Seung Kye shrugged his shoulders. Thats right. Im sorry brother, I relied too much on you. I will reflect on that. Ju Seo Cheon swung his sword and held it right. For now, it doesnt seem like there is any other mechanism in here besides those wooden dolls\u2026but it will be better to be careful. Zhuge Seung Kye warned Ju Seo Cheon as he approached the wooden dolls. Alright, thank you. Will captain Ju be fine alone? Wang il asked. Im fine, just protect Seung well in case something unexpected occurs. Part of the reason he brought Wang il with them was not only to carry their luggage but also to protect Zhuge Seung Kye. Ju Seo Cheon slowly took a step forward while being cautious. The moment he entered a certain range, the wooden doll that was in front of him reacted like lightning and threw a punch. Hm. Ju Seo Cheon jumped backwards quickly and dodged the fist. Huh? He waited for the next attack but it didnt happen. He advanced once again to see what was happening and then, the same attack came towards him. This time, he raised his sword to block the punch. Slash! The wooden arm was cut down by the sword. And Ju Seo Cheon retreated once again. The wooden doll returned to its original position with its arm cut off. So it was like that. He understood what kind of device this was. It seemed that the device was programmed to act in a certain way when you entered a determined range. Can you disarm it? Ju Seo Cheon turned back to look at Zhuge Seung Kye. No. I cant see any mechanism nearby. Zhuge Seung Kye shook his head sideways. I will crush them all then! Ju Seo Cheon charged forward. Haat! He first got rid of the wooden doll that got its arm cut off, by swinging his sword. The doll was cut in half the moment he swung his sword vertically. Ju Seo Cheon had his doubts on how the wooden doll hadnt rotten until now but he didnt think too deeply about it. He just thought that it was thanks to the power of a mechanism device and danced among the wooden dolls. Drrrrrk! The wooden dolls moved along the sound of a device interlocking. Some moved their arms and legs at the same time and some others only kicked or punched with all their strength. All of their reaction speed was like lightning so it would have been hard to even block their attacks for the average martial artist. Most of all, the movements were restricted because the passageway was narrow. Hap! It was certainly impressive but that was all. Ju Seo Cheon was safe inside the attacks of the wooden dolls even though his movements were restricted. He didnt allow even one attack to land on him. He didnt stop at dodging or blocking. He counterattacked and destroyed the wooden dolls. Ju Seo Cheon wasnt facing the wooden dolls just with his swordsmanship. Sometimes, he counterattacked with the Plum Blossom Fist Arts when needed and crushed the dolls. \u2018Hm, Im glad I increased my boundary before coming here. His physical abilities and reflexes had increased a few times. That was thanks to having completed the Universal Plum Blossom Breathing Method and increased his boundary. He had revealed his power about a month ago in the battle against the pirates. There was no need to hide his identity now. Thats why he trained on the Universal Plum Blossom Breathing Method that he had halted on purpose and reached the peak boundary the instant he completed it. His sword techniques didnt change because they were already at grandmaster level but instead, his physical abilities and the total amount of internal energy increased. The total of internal energy he had now was sixty years worth. Ju Seo Cheon counterattacked against the attacks of the wooden dolls with no problem. Ho\u2026 The warriors that saw that scene got amazed. Its just like brother Wang said. He really was an expert. Humans were creatures with lots of doubts. They would doubt you until the end if they didnt confirm it with their own eyes. Even if Wang il had said so himself, they were still half in doubts. Didnt I tell you so? Wang il also got impressed and followed Ju Seo Cheons movements with his eyes. It was to gain even a little bit from that. Are they the so called geniuses\u2026 Cho Ryeon looked at Ju Seo Cheon and Zhuge Seung Kye alternatingly. I dont wanna live anymore. I agree. Zhuge Seung Kye was another matter, however they felt a sense of deprivation when they saw Ju Seo Cheon. Some of them were at their middle ages but werent able to get close to the peak boundary but someone that had just become a youth was already a peak expert. They knew that life was unfair but it was that much painful when they experienced it for themselves. Would they know how beings like us feel? Will they? The warriors shared a conversation with a teary voice. I know it fully well. Ju Seo Cheon answered their words. He took care of the last wooden doll that remained. All of the wooden dolls that were standing still and looking at each other had become a mess. Did you take care of them all? Zhuge Seung Kye asked. It seemed like he was holding back something. Yeah. Why? Then, can I go and inspect those? Zhuge Seung Kyes eyes shone with excitement. Do it in moderation. Ju Seo Cheon nodded. Zhuge Seung Kye started to check the destroyed wooden dolls as soon as he got the permission to do so. He became really bright when it came to things related to machinery. It looks like wood but why didnt it rot\u2026 hoh, it was able to move because of this being connected\u2026 Zhuge Seung Kye was mumbling something while observing the wooden doll. Joo Seo Cheon waited for about ten minutes. There werent many places that you could see a mechanism device in the current Murim and it was an uncommon opportunity for Zhuge Seung Kye. Thats why he favored him, because he knew that. On top of that, there was nothing wrong with Zhuge Seung Kye obtaining knowledge after inspecting the wooden doll as that knowledge would return as a great help for him. Lets start going. Slurp. Zhuge Seung Kye smacked his lips in regret. They started to walk in the passageway again after getting rid of the wooden dolls and were able to see the end of the passageway after about half an hour. The time they relied on their torches also ended. Bright light entered from the end of the passageway. However, they could not relax yet. They had encountered lots of traps in that short time. It was impossible to count how many mechanism devices were installed and everyone doubted everything they saw. Ho. A room that they couldnt even think about welcomed the group as soon as they came out of the passageway. Wh, what is this\u2026. ! Heeok! All of them were shocked. The thing in front of their eyes was a mountain of silver coins that they hadnt been able to see until now. There was no other expression for this. The silver coins piled up on the walls and formed a mountain range of coins. They couldnt grasp how much it would be if they converted it in money. Are there only silver coins? However, Ju Seo Cheon wasnt surprised by that. He checked his surroundings with a flat face and checked if there were no other treasures. Hey! Dont touch that! Zhuge Seung Kye yelled in the middle of his inspection. When they turned their heads they saw Cho Ryeong trying to grab a silver coin. Cho Ryeong scratched the back of her head when her eyes met Ju Seo Cheons as if she was embarrassed and then apologized. Ahem! Sorry for having touched it thoughtlessly. However, all of this will go to the head merchant, cant you close your eyes just this once? It doesnt matter to me but it will be better if you didnt touch it. Think about who was the one that stopped you from doing so. Ah! Only then did Cho Ryeon remember how Zhuge Seung Kye had been helping them. Dont tell me. . ? Wang il frowned and checked the silver coins. Yes. Theres a mechanism installed in it, just like I guessed. There are some that dont, shall I teach you which are? The eyes of the warriors shone in greed at Zhuge Seung Kyes last question, however they were all aware of Ju Seo Cheon. There are other things to prioritize so its impossible if its not a handful of it. Also, you may activate a trap if you drop coins while moving so if you really want to, take some when we return. Ju Seo Cheon spoke as if he had already expected that. Are you speaking about that, captain? Wang il pointed at a wooden chest that was buried under the mountain of coins. Ju Seo Cheon looked at Zhuge Seung Kye and Zhuge Seng Kye nodded telling him that it was fine. He rummaged the mountain of silver coins and then opened the wooden chest and checked its contents. Ho. A pungent smell pinched his nose as soon as he opened the chest. There were pills inside, and no doubt about it, they seemed to be miraculous drugs. Well done. Ju Seo Cheon complimented Wang il and handed him the wooden chest. Wang il looked at the wooden chest as if he was envious but he closed his eyes and stored the chest. It will be better to not get greedy. I will give you suitable compensation when we return safely. Im saying this beforehand but it will be good if you dont think that you can evade my eyes. Ju Seo Cheon warned them in a low tone on purpose. It was to prevent something before it happened. \u2018This is only the beginning. The silver coins were only the appetizers and they had just passed through the first gateway. His chest beat wildly at the rewards that would appear from now on. The group headed towards the next gateway. At Mount Hua. Hat! Nak Seo Wol swung her sword with all her strength while yelling. Kid. Shim Ok Ryeons brows raised ferociously. Yes, master. Nak Seo Wol lowered her sword and answered the call. What do you think I am going to say? Shim Ok Ryeon looked down at Nak Seo Wol with strict eyes. \u2026. Im sorry. Nak Seo Wol apologized for her mistake while being aware of Shim Ok Ryeon. \u2026Haa. Shim Ok Ryeon pressed her forehead and let out a low sigh. Its not that your skills dropped, but they arent getting better either. Is it because of that half-wit? She was referring to Ju Seo Cheon when she said half-wit. It was a nickname that suited to his other nickname of the flashy yet frail one. Hes not a half-wit anymore\u2026 Nak Seo Wol mumbled in a depressed way. It was something that couldnt be imagined at all from the usual her. To speak back against her master, the Iron Plum Sword. This had never happened before. Nak Seo Wol seemed to be surprised herself that she hurriedly covered her mouth. Im, im sorr\u2026 No, its fine. You are right. Shim Ok Ryeon showed an unexpected reaction compared to what she was thinking. He had been hiding his skills. Hes an amazing kid. The reason Shim Ok Ryeon didnt see Ju Seo Cheon in a good light was because she thought that he had been lucky but besides that, he had no skills at all. But that wasnt the case anymore. Her perception of him changed into Ju Seo Cheon having great skills and was also excellent in sword techniques. But thats all. He is already dead. Shim Ok Ryeon spoke coldly. She wasnt called the Iron Plum Sword for nothing. Listen well, kid. When you go out to Kang Ho in the future, you will experience the death of the people surrounding you until you get tired of it. You just experienced it a bit faster. So stop crying and concentrate on training. Death. It was the death of a fellow brother of hers that she had goodwill to. That truth made Nak Seo Wols heart heavy. By the time she got a hold of herself, tears were already dropping from her eyes. Im not so cold as to not give you time to feel sad, but you cant keep crying forever. Forget him now. Ju Seo Cheon is dead. \u2026\u2026. He was alive and kicking. T/N: Hey! I am looking for a replacement translator. As a lot of you might know, I have to drop this novel due to the sheer difficulty of it and I dont have time to commit to it.

It was a nickname that suited to his other nickname of the flashy yet frail one. Hes not a half-wit anymore\u2026 Nak Seo Wol mumbled in a depressed way. It was something that couldnt be imagined at all from the usual her. To speak back against her master, the Iron Plum Sword. This had never happened before. Nak Seo Wol seemed to be surprised herself that she hurriedly covered her mouth. Im, im sorr\u2026 No, its fine. You are right. Shim Ok Ryeon showed an unexpected reaction compared to what she was thinking. He had been hiding his skills. Hes an amazing kid. The reason Shim Ok Ryeon didnt see Ju Seo Cheon in a good light was because she thought that he had been lucky but besides that, he had no skills at all. But that wasnt the case anymore. Her perception of him changed into Ju Seo Cheon having great skills and was also excellent in sword techniques. But thats all. He is already dead. Shim Ok Ryeon spoke coldly. She wasnt called the Iron Plum Sword for nothing. Listen well, kid. When you go out to Kang Ho in the future, you will experience the death of the people surrounding you until you get tired of it. You just experienced it a bit faster. So stop crying and concentrate on training. Death. It was the death of a fellow brother of hers that she had goodwill to. That truth made Nak Seo Wols heart heavy. By the time she got a hold of herself, tears were already dropping from her eyes. Im not so cold as to not give you time to feel sad, but you cant keep crying forever. Forget him now. Ju Seo Cheon is dead. \u2026\u2026. He was alive and kicking. T/N: Hey!

I hope you guys understand. However you may still donate to support us. Yu Jong Mok went out to the periodical assembly. I will probably return after four days. Stay safe till I come back. Have a safe trip, master. Ju Seo Cheon bowed politely and sent Yu Jong Mok off. \u2018Good, today is the day. Four days were enough. He already knew the location of the underwater cave and where the Water Spirit Fruit was growing. It would be a bit tiring but he could return back to Hua Sect in three days. Ju Seo Cheon left the sect secretly, exactly two hours after Yu Jong Mok climbed down the mountain. \u2018Slipping away is not that difficult because of the inner disciples. The inner disciples were mostly the children of rich merchants or precious children of high ranked yangbans. Among them, the youngest children didnt have that much patience so they felt stuffed at the communal style of living and the rules so they skipped out on classes or thought of ways to escape The most representative way among them was to dig a hole under an isolated and old wall and slip off. They normally got outside through this hole to drink alcohol and embrace women and returned. In addition, this secret passage was well known in the sect but they were just pretending to not have seen it. It was because inner disciples ended their training in three years at most or another year more if their comprehension was slow and then descended the mountain. They were going to leave anyway so it would become a bigger pain if the sect didnt tolerate it and so they acted more spoiled. Even if you were inner disciples with a high status or children of people that donated a lot of money, the sect wasnt able to treat them as they wished. Thats why they just left the passage alone and dispatched an expert to monitor it in case of outside infiltrators. It was a known secret to all the disciples of the sect. Even the disciples of the head temple used this passage frequently but there werent many of them. It was because the disciples of the head temple were aware of their masters, compared to the relatively free inner disciples. Because of that Ju Seo Cheon didnt have many days like today. It was about once a year. He still had five years of time left but that didnt mean that he had leisure. He had to go out when he had the opportunity. In addition, there was no need to worry about what happened in the afternoon in the Nakan hell. They only examine them intensively in the beginning but they dont care that much for about one year of making round trips passed. It was because there were too many disciples passing through the Nakan hell in a day. The only time they could check on them continuously was either when they were really young or when not too much time passed since they entered the sect. Ju Seo Cheon got out of the sect through the secret passage with some other inner disciples without attracting too much attention. It was because many prominent figures beside Yu Jong Mok joined the periodical meeting, so quite a lot of disciples slipped away out of the sect this time. Thanks to that, they didnt get stopped by the experts that were expected to be near the hole. The things he took out were some dried out supplies, essential necessities, and some money he saved since his soul entered into his younger body. Ha, how long has it been! Ju Seo Cheon smiled brightly as soon as he descended the mountain and took a deep breath. It was the outside air. He breathed in as slowly and with great satisfaction as he came out of the sect border after an extremely long time. After he became one of the Five Elders before reincarnating, he had to manage his work, so there were few chances to descend the mountain. And after he reincarnated he wasnt able to go outside by force so he also wasnt able to get near the entrance either. Its cold. White steam came out of his mouth. He turned around and saw a river. Ugh, to think I should swim in this weather. Ju Seo Cheon shivered. It was winter, especially. The time he had chosen to get out was the worst. Still, he had no choice. Ju Seo Cheon trimmed his cold protecting clothes and checked the money and items he had in his pocket. After that, he executed the Light Step Arts facing Zuo Yin that was in the north. \u2018The Dark Essence Diagram! Ju Seo Cheon trained in other martial arts secretively besides the Plum Blossom Fist Techniques and Plum Blossom Qi Arts. One of them was the Dark Essence Diagram, one of the representative Light Step Arts of Hua Sect. Originally, it was an art that could only be learned after one turned thirteen or fourteen but that was meaningless for the current Ju Seo Cheon. He already knew the Purple Haze Arts that were only allowed to be learned by the strongest martial artists of Hua Sect. It took one full day for him to reach Zuo Yin. Pant pant, damn it. It was good for saving time that he learned the Light Step Arts but unfortunately, it spent more internal energy than swordsmanship or footwork techniques. Ju Seo Cheon had more internal energy than his peers but it didnt mean that he could use the Light Step Arts all day. It was really exhausting and harsh but he didnt stop moving because the time was limited. Thanks to that, he didnt exceed his time range by that much and arrived at the place. Im lucky that I didnt encounter any thieves. Sh\u0101ns\u00e8 being the base for Mount Hua Sect and the Jong Nam Sect, the security was great. But being great didnt mean it wasnt perfect. It wasnt that there were no mountain thieves or bandits. Thats why he even disguised himself to show that he had nothing on purpose. He should be able to face five of them but it was impossible to face more than that because of his lacking stamina or internal energy so he had to be careful. Thats why this matter was a kind of gamble for Ju Seo Cheon. Whatever the case as soon as Ju Seo Cheon arrived at Zuo Yin, he took some rest, and after buying some things to help him fight any enemies, he got out of the village. If someone picked a fight with him he would only waste strength. There were many cases that they looked down on children and they were also easy targets for robbery so he didnt eat on the way down the mountain on purpose. Being young didnt have only one disadvantage. He was earnest about wanting to grow quickly. Lets start warming up first. He could find his destination without much difficulty. The path going to the underwater cave was located at a remote place that was easy to remember and the path wasnt that complicated either. Ha, I really dont want to enter. There was no need to learn the Arts of Water to reach the underwater cave as you could simply dive. Normal people would suffocate in the middle but it was an exception for martial artists whose breathing capacities were several times more outstanding. Even kids were able to go there. The reason this place wasnt discovered for a long time was that it was at a really remote place and there was nothing else there. In the first place, there was no reason for martial artists to come all the way to this place and enter the cave by diving. You could see that as the ronin managed to reach the underwater cave by luck as he fell down the river and let himself get carried by the current in an unconscious state. One, two, one, two. Ju Seo Cheon loosened his muscles with plenty of warm-ups and then took out his belongings and hid it nearby. There was no one that would come to this secluded place but a beast was able to take it so he dug a hole and covered it with dirt. I just hope I dont freeze to death! Flop! Ju Seo Cheon jumped down to the river. The surface surged up and waved up. \u2018Damn it! He couldnt help but curse as soon as he dived in. A chill penetrated all of his body. It wasnt simply cold but it even chilled the insides of his bones. Taking a cold shower with ice water in plain winter while being naked and then rubbing ice on your skin would probably feel like this. Ju Seo Cheon greatly regretted it not long after diving. \u2018I should have prepared myself a bit more! I want to return right now! But Ju Seo Cheon suppressed his feelings. If he returned back to the river banks in this state, he would only suffer the current pain twice. Nothing else would change. Most of all, he couldnt dive forever. There was a limit to his stamina and he already had spent a lot of strength just by diving into the river once, so it would be harder when he tried again. \u2018Get a hold of yourself, you idiot! He had obtained an opportunity to live one more time but it seemed like he wasnt able to get rid of his nature. He wasnt a great man before he returned in time either. When he tried, it didnt work well, and if it was hard he made excuses and gave up. \u2018If I can save master with this much pain I can take in however much! I will save him even if I fall into hell! He opened his eyes and gritted his teeth. The only person he could call family in his life. The master that saved him when he was an orphan and taught him martial arts. He was a precious person. One who loved his stupid disciple, one that was a fool from beginning to end and the only one that smiled gently to him. Ju Seo Cheon thought of Yu Jong Moks smile and dived with more strength. Water bubbles appeared on the surface. The silent surface started to boil suddenly and then a black shadow arose on top of it. Puha! Ju Seo Cheon took in a deep breath as soon as he got out to the surface. He drank in some water but it didnt matter. Cough, cough! Ju Seo Cheon coughed the water he drank. He then took in fresh air deep in his lungs and exhaled it. Tak tak tak! It was the sound Ju Seo Cheon made with his teeth hitting each other. He looked pale as a corpse. I,I,I, alm, almost f**ked up. Ju Seo Cheon couldnt speak properly and stuttered. He ran out of the water and lied down on the ground without even checking his surroundings. Fortunately, he didnt get lost while coming to the underwater cave. He didnt lack oxygen. He could endure it. His breathing capacity was higher than an adult man thanks to his internal energy. But the water was colder than he thought. The cold was terrible because it was beyond his imagination. If it go-, goes on, Li, li, like this, I, I will die from cold. Ju Seo Cheon pinched his cheeks to endure the sleep invading his body and massaged his body with his hands as he couldnt sense it well. After that, he started to circulate internal energy immediately to drive away the cold and increase it to the maximum. As if proving that it had an effect, Ju Seo Cheons color started to return to his original. Haa\u2026. Ju Seo Cheon opened his closed eyes. \u2018For me to be this weak! He had seen the body and internal energy of a kid too and expected too much out of it. It was harder to endure than he thought. It seemed like he hadnt thought much about it because he remembered that he felt nothing when he came to this place before returning in time. \u2018I dont have much time. Lets retrieve the Water Spirit Fruit and return. It was so cold that it could drive him crazy but it wasnt to the point that he would die. Ju Seo Cheon stood up from his place and walked inside the cave. Step step. The silent cave started to get filled with the echoes of Ju Seo Cheons steps. \u2018Um, I was worried about the darkness but Im glad there is moss. It wasnt that bright but the moss that released faint light grew on the boulders and they illuminated the path. If there had been no moss, he would have had to stick to the walls and walk carefully. If he utilized his internal energy and increased his insight he would be able to see but he had to leave internal energy for when he returned to the ground. After about fifteen minutes passed. The passage that only two people could pass through started t o get wider and when the path reached an end an open space that could hold a hundred people appeared. The empty space was also filled with moss and when the faint light gathered together they boasted a considerable brightness. I found\u2026Hup! Ju Seo Cheon was about to cheer but held his breath. He then lowered his posture and blocked his mouth. \u2018Just what\u2026!","title":"volcanic-6"},{"location":"volcanic-6/#vocanic-age-chapter-6","text":"Editor: Summerstood, Imagine Announcement from Imagine for VA: Just a heads up guys for now we wont be accepting sponsored chapters for VA as of late because the chaps take time and we want to focus on making sure we can release chapters on time rather than being rushed to post daily for it.

He then lowered his posture and blocked his mouth. \u2018Just what\u2026!","title":"Vocanic Age Chapter 6"},{"location":"volcanic-7/","text":"Vocanic Age Chapter 7 Editor: Summerstood, Imagine, The place he arrived at was indeed the underwater cave from his memories. The moss he saw at the beginning shone brightly with a green light and filled the entire cave. What he saw after that was a huge tree that was so big it made one gape in awe. The countless branches that grew and extended in a complicated manner filled the ceiling and the walls along the moss. The peculiarity the leaves had was that they were blue instead of green. The tree boasted great thickness that made you wonder if it were a thousand years old. Lastly, the roots that supported the tree covered the entire floor. \u2018The underwater tree! It was a tree that grew under the water just like its name implied. The most amazing thing was that it could grow even without the rays of the sun. In addition, the underwater tree was considered as a rare species and there were not many of them even in the entire central plains. But the reason Ju Seo Cheon got surprised wasnt because he saw the underwater tree. And it wasnt that he couldnt discover the Water Spirit Fruit either. He saw the fruit that the ronin talked about twenty years ago rolling on the floor. But there was one difference. There was something he didnt know about even before he returned back in time. \u2018Just what is that! It was a snake. It wasnt as big as the underwater tree but it was still a size that was outside common sense. The size wasnt normal at first glance but it did seem to be about as long as five adults together. Its length was amazing enough but the thickness it had was also outstanding. It seemed to be about three foot thick. \u2018A spiritual being! Animals or plants that had a miraculous energy and abilities were called spiritual beings and the underwater tree also belonged to that category. In the case of plants, they werent that dangerous. Normally, the dangerous ones were the ones that had poison. But the danger spiritual animals posed was serious. They were as intelligent as humans and the strength they possessed could even threaten experts. \u2018With a body that size\u2026 Ju Seo Cheon had read a considerable number of books before returning back in time as he spent a lot of time being alone. There was a book about spiritual beings among them, and he got quite knowledgeable thanks to the information in that book. \u2018Damn it, its a spiritual being thats at least a few hundred years old. Snakes, in particular, were as dangerous as wild beasts. When snakes become spiritual beings, most of them have their strength and speed increase and their scales also get hard enough to deflect sword aura. But the most frightening thing was the poison hidden in their fangs. \u2018It seems like its sleeping right now but\u2026 He had cursed hundreds of times that it was now winter, but that wasnt the case now. He was thankful that it was winter. All snakes, whether they are spiritual beings or not, hibernate in winter. Thanks to that he was able to not get discovered and live. \u2018If I were to engage it in a fight\u2026no, if I wake it up I will die. Against a spiritual being like this, peak and transcendent experts had to join hands to barely be able to defeat it. It would be hard fighting it without having sword qi, a power that boasted of having a more absolute cutting power than any renowned sword. So, going against that snake when he didnt even have the martial arts from before returning in time was no different from suicide. \u2018If that thing existed twenty years later\u2026Theres no way I would have heard of it. Because it wouldnt have existed. ; If it was that light mouthed ronin, he would have told the world that he came back alive from that snake. But not having been able to hear of it twenty years later meant that that snake wasnt present. He didnt know why. It could have been hunted down by another spiritual being or secluded masters in the past, or it could have also turned into an imugi. But that wasnt the case now. That snake was hibernating in this underwater cave. His luck was disgustingly bad. \u2018Should I escape? Spiritual beings werent spiritual beings for nothing. It may feel his presence if he got close to it and may wake up from its sleep. If that happened he would really die. \u2018But its a waste to return now that I came all the way here. He raised his head and checked the underwater tree. He could see a fruit under the overwhelmingly big trunk. The fruit was dyed blue. It was the Water Spirit Fruit. He checked the other parts such as the roots and branches but the only Water Spirit Fruit he could see was the one on the floor. \u2018Im sure thats the one. He also knew about the Water Spirit Fruits characteristics thanks to that Ronin going around telling everyone about it. \u2018But\u2026. The head of the huge snake that was in deep sleep was right next to it. He didnt have the courage to get closer. Ju Seo Cheon racked his brains and fell in thought. Should he step back here? Or advance? He didnt think for long. Ju Seo Cheon lowered his body and hid his presence the most he could. Then, he started to advance slowly like a turtle. \u2018Master! He had another opportunity next week but there was no guarantee the snake wouldnt be at that time. It would be the end if it used this place as its nest until he turned fourteen. Yu Jong Mok would die just like in history. That uneasiness and fear gave Ju Seo Cheon courage. Ju Seo Cheon held his breath and approached the Water Spirit Fruit carefully. Thump! Thump! It was the sound of his heart that he didnt normally pay attention but right now, he heard it as loudly as thunder cracking. Ju Seo Cheon moved soundlessly while being aware of the snake. \u2018I dont want to regret it later. He had regretted it many times in the past and still couldnt forget that vexation and resentment. \u2018Huh? When he got closer he was able to see it quite well. It was a fruit that would fit the palm of a hand perfectly. But there was something different from when he saw it from far away. \u2018Theres not one of them but two? He couldnt see it before because there was a slight windfall. But when he got closer he got able to see another Water Spirit Fruit. \u2018What a windfall! He was so happy a laughter almost came out. The ronin revealed that he had only taken one fruit. If he made a guess, the remaining fruit could have been destroyed by the snake when it left the cave. \u2018Good, carefully. Calmly. He bowed down and extended his hand. He grabbed it and embraced it so that it made no sound and didnt roll away. He retrieved one fruit safely and also managed to get a hold of the remaining one carefully. \u2018Okay! He forced back his happiness and straightened his back. The snake that was still sleeping next to him didnt move. Ju Seo Cheon cheered inwardly and turned around. But at that moment, Ju Seo Cheon froze up. He could see golden eyes from the half opened eyes of the beast. Ju Seo Cheons dazed look was reflected at the vertically slit pupils. Ju Seo Cheon forgot about breathing. No, he forgot to think. The snake stared at Ju Seo Cheon blankly with slightly open eyes. It wasnt the will of a beast looking at prey. Those emotionless eyes were as cold as the water in the river above ground. Drip. Something fell on his head. It was water. At least, that wasnt water the snake spilled. It was a water drop that fell from the ceiling. He made eye contact with the snake. The nine year old kid that was looking at its eyes. The snakes eyes showed fulfilment and laziness. The snake blinked its eyes a few times and then turned its head to the other side as if it had lost all interest. Bang. The underwater cave shook slightly when the snake changed position because of the considerable weight of its head. That was the end. He didnt know if the snake had fallen asleep again or was trying to fall asleep because he couldnt see its face. Ju Seo Cheon, who was frozen like ice, started to walk again. He didnt know how much time it took. His mind had turned blank. He couldnt even think. But his hands werent letting go of the Water Spirit Fruit. Ju Seo Cheon returned back to the path he came. He didnt run or walk quickly. He walked slowly as if he was taking a stroll and slowly entered the water. Swoosh. A head arose on the surface. It belonged to a kid. The kid, Ju Seo Cheon, was able to escape. The sun was at its peak when he had dived down. But right now, the sun was setting and dying the sky in red and he thought that the red color was really beautiful. Ju Seo Cheon mumbled in a melancholic face after getting above the surface. I pissed myself\u2026 Ju Seo Cheon retrieved the Water Spirit Fruit safely and returned to Mount Hua Sect. Four days later. Yu Jong Mok returned from the meeting around dinner. And a few days later Ju Seo Cheon fell in his thoughts. \u2018How do I give this to master? There were no fruits like the Water Spirit Fruit in the Mount Hua Sect. Even its appearance wasnt normal. The size was normal but it reflected the color of water. You could notice at a glance that it wasnt normal. \u2018Whew, in the first place it is too dangerous to pledge saying that its not a miraculous medicine. Miraculous medicines werent over after being consumed. You needed special precautions when taking in miraculous medicines that possessed a huge amount of energy, just like the Water Spirit Fruit. If you took it with no preparations at all, you would get bewildered at the vast energy entering your body suddenly. And then, that bewilderment would turn into not being able to control it and in the worst case situation, your internal energy may explode and suffer from internal distortion. \u2018Ugh. He wouldnt be able to evade getting suspected of having stolen it no matter how he told him about it. If you wanted to buy a miraculous medicine such as this one you needed at least a thousand gold coins, and it made no sense to say that he picked it up on the floor. He also wasnt able to say that he stole it from someone as a disciple of the Righteous Sect. And he didnt even have the ability to do so in the first place. Ju Seo Cheon wasnt able to do anything about it and let out a sigh while groaning. Is there something wrong? Yu Jong Mok noticed that something was troubling his disciple not long after. Ma, master! Your face was full of worry and uneasiness these days. Its not bad to receive help from your surroundings at times when you couldnt solve it alone. Yu Jong Mok stroke Ju Seo Cheons head like usual. Ugh. Ju Seo Cheon had the appearance of a child but he was an old man inside. Looking at it in age, experience or insight in martial arts, he was a few levels above Yu Jong Mok. But marvelously enough, whether he returned in time or not, he felt like he had really turned into a kid when he was in front of Yu Jong Mok. Besides that, it was really hard for him to hide something from his master. In front of others, he acted inconspicuously as to not seem suspicious and evaded attracting any attention. His acting skills were also quite considerable that everyone fell for it. Excluding one person, Yu Jong Mok, the person that was in front of him. \u2018Right. Its no use being suspected of hiding something and then being interrogated. Ju Seo Cheon gulped down as if he had determined himself. \u2018If its to save master\u2026 If the time to take the medicine ended today? He got the chills as soon as he thought of that. But of course, that may be a bit too excessive. Ju Seo Cheon himself thought that his worries were a bit excessive. But the \u2018what if clung in his heart heavily. Ju Seo Cheon took out the Water Spirit Fruit with courage. Master, wont you take this? Its a miraculous medicine. Ju Seo Cheon spoke with no hesitation at all. \u2018Hah. He feigned a laugh inwardly because it was too absurd. A nine year old kid was groaning as if he was about to poop and suddenly took out a miraculous medicine then suddenly told you to take it. Everyone would get dumbfounded. Yu Jong Mok kept silent. His eyes fell to the water colored fruit that Ju Seo Cheon was holding. A moment of silence. And then, Yu Jong Mok finally opened his mouth.","title":"volcanic-7"},{"location":"volcanic-7/#vocanic-age-chapter-7","text":"Editor: Summerstood, Imagine, The place he arrived at was indeed the underwater cave from his memories. The moss he saw at the beginning shone brightly with a green light and filled the entire cave. What he saw after that was a huge tree that was so big it made one gape in awe. The countless branches that grew and extended in a complicated manner filled the ceiling and the walls along the moss. The peculiarity the leaves had was that they were blue instead of green. The tree boasted great thickness that made you wonder if it were a thousand years old. Lastly, the roots that supported the tree covered the entire floor. \u2018The underwater tree! It was a tree that grew under the water just like its name implied. The most amazing thing was that it could grow even without the rays of the sun. In addition, the underwater tree was considered as a rare species and there were not many of them even in the entire central plains. But the reason Ju Seo Cheon got surprised wasnt because he saw the underwater tree. And it wasnt that he couldnt discover the Water Spirit Fruit either. He saw the fruit that the ronin talked about twenty years ago rolling on the floor. But there was one difference. There was something he didnt know about even before he returned back in time. \u2018Just what is that! It was a snake. It wasnt as big as the underwater tree but it was still a size that was outside common sense. The size wasnt normal at first glance but it did seem to be about as long as five adults together. Its length was amazing enough but the thickness it had was also outstanding. It seemed to be about three foot thick. \u2018A spiritual being! Animals or plants that had a miraculous energy and abilities were called spiritual beings and the underwater tree also belonged to that category. In the case of plants, they werent that dangerous. Normally, the dangerous ones were the ones that had poison. But the danger spiritual animals posed was serious. They were as intelligent as humans and the strength they possessed could even threaten experts. \u2018With a body that size\u2026 Ju Seo Cheon had read a considerable number of books before returning back in time as he spent a lot of time being alone. There was a book about spiritual beings among them, and he got quite knowledgeable thanks to the information in that book. \u2018Damn it, its a spiritual being thats at least a few hundred years old. Snakes, in particular, were as dangerous as wild beasts. When snakes become spiritual beings, most of them have their strength and speed increase and their scales also get hard enough to deflect sword aura. But the most frightening thing was the poison hidden in their fangs. \u2018It seems like its sleeping right now but\u2026 He had cursed hundreds of times that it was now winter, but that wasnt the case now. He was thankful that it was winter. All snakes, whether they are spiritual beings or not, hibernate in winter. Thanks to that he was able to not get discovered and live. \u2018If I were to engage it in a fight\u2026no, if I wake it up I will die. Against a spiritual being like this, peak and transcendent experts had to join hands to barely be able to defeat it. It would be hard fighting it without having sword qi, a power that boasted of having a more absolute cutting power than any renowned sword. So, going against that snake when he didnt even have the martial arts from before returning in time was no different from suicide. \u2018If that thing existed twenty years later\u2026Theres no way I would have heard of it. Because it wouldnt have existed. ; If it was that light mouthed ronin, he would have told the world that he came back alive from that snake. But not having been able to hear of it twenty years later meant that that snake wasnt present. He didnt know why. It could have been hunted down by another spiritual being or secluded masters in the past, or it could have also turned into an imugi. But that wasnt the case now. That snake was hibernating in this underwater cave. His luck was disgustingly bad. \u2018Should I escape? Spiritual beings werent spiritual beings for nothing. It may feel his presence if he got close to it and may wake up from its sleep. If that happened he would really die. \u2018But its a waste to return now that I came all the way here. He raised his head and checked the underwater tree. He could see a fruit under the overwhelmingly big trunk. The fruit was dyed blue. It was the Water Spirit Fruit. He checked the other parts such as the roots and branches but the only Water Spirit Fruit he could see was the one on the floor. \u2018Im sure thats the one. He also knew about the Water Spirit Fruits characteristics thanks to that Ronin going around telling everyone about it. \u2018But\u2026. The head of the huge snake that was in deep sleep was right next to it. He didnt have the courage to get closer. Ju Seo Cheon racked his brains and fell in thought. Should he step back here? Or advance? He didnt think for long. Ju Seo Cheon lowered his body and hid his presence the most he could. Then, he started to advance slowly like a turtle. \u2018Master! He had another opportunity next week but there was no guarantee the snake wouldnt be at that time. It would be the end if it used this place as its nest until he turned fourteen. Yu Jong Mok would die just like in history. That uneasiness and fear gave Ju Seo Cheon courage. Ju Seo Cheon held his breath and approached the Water Spirit Fruit carefully. Thump! Thump! It was the sound of his heart that he didnt normally pay attention but right now, he heard it as loudly as thunder cracking. Ju Seo Cheon moved soundlessly while being aware of the snake. \u2018I dont want to regret it later. He had regretted it many times in the past and still couldnt forget that vexation and resentment. \u2018Huh? When he got closer he was able to see it quite well. It was a fruit that would fit the palm of a hand perfectly. But there was something different from when he saw it from far away. \u2018Theres not one of them but two? He couldnt see it before because there was a slight windfall. But when he got closer he got able to see another Water Spirit Fruit. \u2018What a windfall! He was so happy a laughter almost came out. The ronin revealed that he had only taken one fruit. If he made a guess, the remaining fruit could have been destroyed by the snake when it left the cave. \u2018Good, carefully. Calmly. He bowed down and extended his hand. He grabbed it and embraced it so that it made no sound and didnt roll away. He retrieved one fruit safely and also managed to get a hold of the remaining one carefully. \u2018Okay! He forced back his happiness and straightened his back. The snake that was still sleeping next to him didnt move. Ju Seo Cheon cheered inwardly and turned around. But at that moment, Ju Seo Cheon froze up. He could see golden eyes from the half opened eyes of the beast. Ju Seo Cheons dazed look was reflected at the vertically slit pupils. Ju Seo Cheon forgot about breathing. No, he forgot to think. The snake stared at Ju Seo Cheon blankly with slightly open eyes. It wasnt the will of a beast looking at prey. Those emotionless eyes were as cold as the water in the river above ground. Drip. Something fell on his head. It was water. At least, that wasnt water the snake spilled. It was a water drop that fell from the ceiling. He made eye contact with the snake.

And then, Yu Jong Mok finally opened his mouth.","title":"Vocanic Age Chapter 7"},{"location":"volcanic-8/","text":"Vocanic Age Chapter 8 Editor: Summerstood, Imagine Did you steal it? Yu Jong Mok raised his head and looked at Ju Seo Cheon. No. Ju Seo Cheon shook his head sideways and denied it. Did you steal it? No. Then, did you trick others? Absolutely not. Ju Seo Cheon answered negatively at all the questions. There was not a trace of hesitation or trembling. His eyes shone brightly like Yu Jong Moks righteous eyes. However, those eyes were filled with a resolve that seemed to have the drive to accomplish what they sought out to do. Where did you get this from then? Um\u2026 Ju Seo Cheon told the truth to Yu Jong Mok, but he didnt tell all of it. It was only to the point that he sneaked out of Hua Sect while Yu Jong Mok was absent and went to the underwater cave. He didnt say something crazy like he had come from the future. But he also didnt make a lie to cover it up. No, it was more correct to say that he couldnt say it. Yu Jong Mok kneeled down without saying anything. It seems like you are still hiding something from me. Ju Seo Cheon flinched and got surprised. He didnt say it out loud but his face was expressing the doubt of \u2018how did he know?. Yu Jong Mok stroked the Water Spirit Fruit that was still in Ju Seo Cheons hands. I can know just by looking at your eyes. Master\u2026 I\u2026 Stop. Yu Jong Mok received the Water Spirit Fruit from his disciple. I will believe in you. He didnt say anything after that. That was the end. He didnt inquire or ask any questions. Yu Jong Mok believed the words of a nine-year-old kid. He did have his doubts but he didnt ask them out. He just received the miraculous medicine without saying anything else. Is that really the end? On the other hand, the one that was in doubt was Ju Seo Cheon. How\u2026why dont you have any doubts? He was the one that wanted his master to just let it pass. But this situation was weird even when he thought about it. At that question, Yu Jong Mok smiled gently just like usual and answered that question. If the master doesnt believe his disciple, who would? If I was really doubtful I would have already inquired one year ago. Ju Seo Cheon dropped his mouth and couldnt hide his shock. \u2018So he knew about it\u2026! One year ago, when he returned back in time was when he consciously had to act like a kid as to not attract any type of suspicion He had thought that his act was quite perfect but it was in vain. Yu Jong Mok knew everything, from one to ten. Yu Jong Mok smiled bitterly as Ju Seo Cheons face changed greatly and added some words. Even I dont know what it is exactly. But I could feel that you matured at some point but you were trying to hide it. No matter how fast a child grew, there was a limit to it. The result of having observed his disciple from up close was that his disciple was acting strangely. At first, he thought that he had felt a devil. There were cases where you turned crazy if your training in martial arts went wrong. It wasnt for nothing that masters stayed right next to their disciples to observe them. They would make mistakes at times because they were immature. But it seemed like that wasnt the case either. He had thought about it and made some hypotheses about it, but no logic worked through. He only thought that it was \u2018fine. You hid it because there are certain circumstances, right? Ju Seo Cheon nodded. If that is the case, there should also be a reason behind why you brought me this miraculous medicine. It cant be helped then. Yu Jong Mok embraced Ju Seo Cheon. Master\u2026Thank you. The disciple hugged his master tightly and then shed tears while leaning on his face. Yu Jong Mok patted Ju Seo Cheons back and cracked a joke. You pissed yourself down there and now you are also pissing from upwards. Master\u2026That is a bit\u2026. Sob! Ju Seo Cheon cried and then became serious. Yu Jong Mok became awkward when the joke he had prepared got rejected. \u2018I said that to make him laugh\u2026It didnt work? Ahh, master! It was also good to show off tight affection between master and disciple. But what was more important than that was applying the miraculous medicine. Ju Seo Cheon explained about the Water Spirit Fruit in detail so that Yu Jong Mok would be able to absorb the miraculous medicine better. Actually, there were no specific details in it. The only thing was that it had two properties, being water and wood. Then, I will ask you to protect me. Yu Jong Mok took in the Water Spirit Fruit and went to circulate his energy. \u2018Its amazing. He was able to feel the energy of the miraculous medicine when he closed his eyes and concentrated. It was also the first time for Yu Jong Mok to have applied a miraculous medicine. It wasnt that there were no miraculous medicines in a big sect like Mount Hua but they also werent overflowing with it to give it to anyone. Only a minority of prodigies were allowed to have miraculous medicines. But even them only took in at most one miraculous medicine in all their life. \u2018Right, lets keep\u2026. Huk? Yu Jong Mok got flustered while circulating his internal energy. Fortunately, he was able to keep his composure because he was controlling his emotions with the Taoist methods. \u2018What in the world happened? Yu Jong Mok had never taken in miraculous medicine before but he knew really well what he needed to do because of the manuals he had read. In the case you consumed a miraculous medicine, most of them circulated that energy to guide it into the dantian and pile it up like internal energy. But in the case that the energy of the miraculous medicine was enormous if you converted it into internal energy your vessels and dantian wouldnt be able to endure it and would explode. For that to not happen, they had to move it slowly and convert it little by little to make it their own. But what happened to Yu Jong Mok was completely different. In a really short instant, his qi moved on its own without him being able to do anything about it. His energy didnt explode. If that was the case, his organs would have gotten twisted and torn apart. The qi of the Water Spirit Fruit, the water, and wood energy entered deep into Yu Jong Moks body without him being able to act. \u2018Is the internal energy running rampant? His mind and consciousness trembled slightly. And the first thing he thought about was \u2018hes still nine years old\u2026 It was the face of his disciple, Ju Seo Cheon. He didnt doubt that the miraculous medicine came with defects. And he didnt even worry about his life or internal energy. He was only worried about his disciple. And then, at that moment. \u2018Huk! The water and wood energy that had disappeared entered a deeper part of his body. \u2018So that was the case! His worries and doubts disappeared. All the fog that had distorted his view also disappeared. And instead, he got able to realize something. But it wasnt insight in martial arts or an art. It was about his body that was relatively weak since he was young. \u2018So there was a problem with my vessel! The qi people were born with, the origin of life and another kind of great nature. This was called the vessel. Only that his vessel was a bit different from normal internal energy. First, the vessel was the origin of life. Spending this meant spending your life. The power of the vessel was so incredible that if you used it you would be able to obtain great strength, but you would die not long after that. Even if you didnt use all of it and someone managed to stay alive, you would still end up disabled or age drastically. Also, the power you spent wouldnt get replenished again. Using it would mark the end of you, no medicine could help you then. Yu Jong Mok had a problem in his vessel\u2026and for some reason, that medicine saved him even though it shouldnt have. \u2018Seo Cheon saved me, he saved me! Yu Jong Mok stood up from his seat abruptly. He wanted to hug his disciple hurriedly. Ju Seo Cheon got surprised as Yu Jong Mok got out of the room he was taking guard in a hurry after not even an hour passed. At first, he got worried that something may have gone wrong but he felt relieved at the laughter he heard after that. Yu Jong Mok embraced Ju Seo Cheon happily and when he finally managed to calm himself after a while he started to tell the changes in his body. Precisely speaking, it didnt seem like the vessel was the problem but the bowl that contained it. The bowl? Yu Jong Mok nodded at Ju Seo Cheons question. Right. It was faint but it seemed like my vessel was flowing out from somewhere. Even Ju Seo Cheon didnt know much about the vessel. That was the same in the past, the present, and in the future. There was nothing concrete that got revealed. Only the concept was transmitted down from long ago. They didnt even know where the vessel was located. It would flow out from somewhere when you wanted to use it after concentrating your mind about it, and it would get expended. The problem was that even the users could only think and feel it. They werent able to comprehend the logic behind it at all. That was the same for experts or small fries. Whatever the case, there was a problem in the bowl containing this vessel so his qi was being spent really minutely. That amount was the size of a hair thread, no, it was smaller than that. But even that amount gave a big influence in the body. It was an obvious thing as the origin of life got expended. It would be weirder if your body didnt show any problems. Even if you trained in martial arts to accumulate internal energy, that was a completely different boundary from the vessel so it couldnt get solved. \u2018Indeed, I barely know what happened. The vitality of the wood energy fixed the bowl of the vessel. Yu Jong Moko was able to understand what had happened despite the lack of information given by Ju Seo Cheon. Yu Jong Mok was teaching him diligently on the outside but Ju Seo Cheon already knew so much he could supplement his teachers teachings. In the first place, there was no way Ju Seo Cheon wouldnt know something Yu Jong Mok did as he was someone that had climbed to become an elder. \u2018Wood is life. Its not at the level of the vessel but the energy of the Spirit Water Fruit can replace it. So he complimented it with that. He had blocked what was flowing out so there was nothing to worry about now. It seemed like the Spirit Water Fruit also filled up what was already spent. To think that the wood energy replenished the life energy spent in the vessel! It had completely crushed the logic that it was never recoverable. \u2018It would not have been possible for others but it was possible indeed because it was master. Yu Jong Mok didnt use his vessel. If he had, he would have already died by now. The problem that had occurred in the bowl was really minute that not even he felt that a little bit of energy had flowed out. But even that small amount had to be recovered with the help of a peerless miraculous medicine like the Spirit Water Fruit. In addition, the energy of the Spirit Water Fruit was only used to fix the vessel. It couldnt be turned into internal energy. Yu Jong Mok only got healthy and he wasnt able to convert the energy of the miraculous medicine into internal energy at all. In the end, you arent able to use the vessel if you werent determined to die. Yu Jong Mok was also wary of this. Only that Yu Jong Mok was a really special case. \u2018Leave it. Thats not the important thing. The important thing was that the future had changed. There was nothing to worry about even if the fourteenth year passed. His master Yu Jong Mok wouldnt die. In the past, he had seen his master pass away hopelessly. He had lost his only beloved person, his only family. There were still many things he hadnt been able to learn. You should take this. The Water Spirit Fruit entered Ju Seo Cheons hand. Master! Dont tell me to take it just in case. I know my body more than anyone else. Your master is fine. Then, you should use it to accumulate internal energy\u2026 If that is the case, then you need it more than me. It seemed like Yu Jong Mok wouldnt yield either. Ju Seo Cheon tried to convince him a bit more but he had to resign after watching Yu Jong Moks strict face. Yu Jong Mok was boundlessly gentle and soft but he was so stubborn no one was able to stop him once he had decided to act. Ju Seo Cheon knew that better than anyone else. \u2018Right, okay. Lets not push it anymore. The disciple had conceded to the stubbornness of his master. I understand. You thought well. Only then did Yu Jong Mok start smiling again. A month later\u2026 The sun hadnt yet set. The outside was filled with white snow to the point it blinded you whilst the cold wind blew. The disciples were busy combing. Whew\u2026 Ju Seo Cheon opened his closed eyes slowly. \u2018I finally made it all my own. Ju Seo Cheon had taken in the Water Spirit Fruit one month ago. But the energy of the miraculous medicine was higher than he thought. He wasnt able to absorb it at once at the level he was at, with the body of a kid. Thats why he had to invest a month to absorb the energy slowly so that there were no aftereffects in his body. That internal energy was worth half of a sexagenary cycle. Half of a sexagenary cycle, that meant it was thirty years! To accumulate thirty years worth of internal energy in only one month! Adding up his two and a half years worth of internal energy and another half a years worth of energy of having circulated the Plum Blossom Life Arts for one month amounted to a total of thirty-three years. How unfortunate. Ju Seo Cheon smacked his lips. The energy the Water Spirit Fruit had was really incredible. Perhaps But unfortunately, his body wasnt able to keep up. If you kept pouring water to a bowl it would one day overflow. It was the same with the dantian. It was still too small to absorb all the energy of the Water Spirit Fruit and so he wasnt able to make the sixty years worth of internal energy his. \u2018But its not like I threw it away, so lets be satisfied with this. He had instead invested it in his blood vessels. He strengthened them so that the passageways wouldnt collapse. But the problem was that doing so caused him a bit of pain. Originally, he had to expand them in a certain order but it happened because he expanded them in an instant. He didnt suffer internal injuries thanks to having used the wood energy that had a particularly strong recovery and regenerative power. Whew, I finally completed the Plum Blossom Qi Arts. The reason it stagnated at the tenth star was that he lacked internal energy. With the increase of internal energy his limits also naturally increased. You finally made the energy in the miraculous medicine to be yours. Every day would have been an ordeal, you are really amazing. Yu Jong Mok, who was standing guard, praised him. In the past month, he had taken attention to his masters health. But after consuming the medicine he didnt show any signs of coughing or being sick. But only a month passed so he couldnt be fully sure about it. He was still observing him. Mm, thirty years\u2026 Yu Jong Mok sensed the pulse of his disciple and let out a sigh of exclamation. The miraculous medicine is impressive indeed. It wasnt normal to possess this much internal energy when you were only nine. It was the same in Mount Hua Sect and other great sects. In the case of noble families, if there was only one person that would continue the generation, they would be able to support that person with miraculous medicines regardless of their age. But excluding those special cases, they werent able to hand over miraculous medicines carelessly. Thats why they would first thoroughly check their talent on martial arts and the temperament of a person after they become an adult. It was a thing that was that hard to obtain so it was really strange to see a young kid overflowing with this much internal energy. Good, if its this much you should be able to start the enhancement gymnastics with your master. Lets start training with me starting from today. Enhancement gymnastics\u2026? Ju Seo Cheon tilted his head at the unknown words. He may not be able to remember those words or it was the first time hearing it but those words werent in his memories before returning in time. Yu Jong Mok smiled back softly at him and explained. Its a gymnastics variant I came up with to try to fix this weak constitution. The name is something I just came up with, and you can think of it as a kind of physical training. In the past, Yu Jong Mok had worked harder than anyone else to try to fix his body that was less healthy than others. That effort continued even after he fell out of being a Plum Blossom Sword Examiner. Because of that, he pursued various methods and one of them was the self-developed health enhancement gymnastics. \u2018But he didnt teach me that in my past life\u2026? Ju Seo Cheons doubts soon got cleared by Yu Jong Mok. Your body has thirty-three years worth of internal energy sleeping. Its an incredible amount. In addition, Yu Jong Mok didnt know about the Plum Blossom Life Arts. He thought that the thirty-two years worth of internal energy came from consuming the miraculous medicine. But you cant see that as being the only thing you need. \u2018Huh? What does he mean? Ju Seo Cheon got awe struck at Yu Jong Moks remark. He had worked really hard to absorb the energy in the miraculous medicine and use it efficiently. He had recalled all the memories of his past so he couldnt help but tilt his head when Yu Jong Mok remarked that it wasnt good. He felt really sorry for his master that was like the sky, but Ju Seo Cheon was several times higher when it came to martial arts. There is a saying in Murim that goes \u2018A healthy qi in a healthy body. Healthy qi would permeate in a healthy body. That meant the harmony between internal energy and the body. Balance is an important thing. The body of a person is more delicate than you think, so if the balance breaks even a little it will get destroyed. That is the same for your body. \u2018Aha! Only then did Ju Seo Cheon nod in understanding. It wasnt that he gained insight into something he didnt know about. He obviously knew about it. \u2018I cant say that I already know all of that. There was no way Ju Seo Cheon didnt know something important like that. Training his body was something he was planning to do slowly. \u2018Um, indeed. Its not that I dont remember it but that it didnt happen. In his past life, he was so busy trying to catch up that he wasnt able to focus on balance or such things. There was no way they would only teach him how to train his body in that situation. Then, I will receive your teachings starting from today. Ju Seo Cheon only pretended to be happy and got sincerely happy. It was a memory with his master that wasnt present in his past life. \u2018Mm, but will mere gymnastics be enough? It seems like I should sneak out to train alone. In the first place, masters version of gymnastics was designed for a person with a weak body. He had doubts about how much that would help him. \u2018Would it be hard? Ju Seo Cheon looked at Yu Jong Mok and smiled like a fool\u2026 The fourth day of having started the enhancement gymnastics. People tend to make regrets. Regardless of age or gender. It was the same for Ju Seo Cheon. He cursed himself for having smiled like a fool four days ago. He cursed and cried many times for having thought it would be easy. \u2018Graaaaaaaagh! Terrible pain was felt in all his body. This level of pain was one of the greatest he felt even in his past life. No, perhaps it may be the first time he felt this. \u2018Something is wrong. Ju Seo Cheon fell in his thoughts at the pain that was transmitted in his arms, no, in his entire body. His bones creaked and his muscles seemed to tear apart. Some of his nails already broke and his hands were filled with blisters. The pain that followed that was no joke. Four days ago was when he started with the enhancement gymnastics. At first, it was simple gymnastics. He warmed up like Yu Jong Mok taught him to. It really was simple gymnastics. After that, he had to make a roundtrip using the Light Step Arts. He consumed his internal energy in an instant as he did as he was told to. After that, he got complimented by Yu Jong Mok and got dragged somewhere. It was below a cliff. Now, climb up. \u2026 We will start daily update next week Donate $ on Kofi and mention Volcanic Age for keep our release speed!

Yu Jong Mok raised his head and looked at Ju Seo Cheon. No. Ju Seo Cheon shook his head sideways and denied it. Did you steal it? No. Then, did you trick others? Absolutely not. Ju Seo Cheon answered negatively at all the questions. There was not a trace of hesitation or trembling. His eyes shone brightly like Yu Jong Moks righteous eyes. However, those eyes were filled with a resolve that seemed to have the drive to accomplish what they sought out to do. Where did you get this from then? Um\u2026 Ju Seo Cheon told the truth to Yu Jong Mok, but he didnt tell all of it. It was only to the point that he sneaked out of Hua Sect while Yu Jong Mok was absent and went to the underwater cave. He didnt say something crazy like he had come from the future. But he also didnt make a lie to cover it up. No, it was more correct to say that he couldnt say it. Yu Jong Mok kneeled down without saying anything. It seems like you are still hiding something from me. Ju Seo Cheon flinched and got surprised. He didnt say it out loud but his face was expressing the doubt of \u2018how did he know?. Yu Jong Mok stroked the Water Spirit Fruit that was still in Ju Seo Cheons hands. I can know just by looking at your eyes. Master\u2026 I\u2026 Stop. Yu Jong Mok received the Water Spirit Fruit from his disciple. I will believe in you. He didnt say anything after that. That was the end. He didnt inquire or ask any questions. Yu Jong Mok believed the words of a nine-year-old kid. He did have his doubts but he didnt ask them out. He just received the miraculous medicine without saying anything else. Is that really the end? On the other hand, the one that was in doubt was Ju Seo Cheon. How\u2026why dont you have any doubts? He was the one that wanted his master to just let it pass. But this situation was weird even when he thought about it. At that question, Yu Jong Mok smiled gently just like usual and answered that question. If the master doesnt believe his disciple, who would? If I was really doubtful I would have already inquired one year ago. Ju Seo Cheon dropped his mouth and couldnt hide his shock. \u2018So he knew about it\u2026! One year ago, when he returned back in time was when he consciously had to act like a kid as to not attract any type of suspicion He had thought that his act was quite perfect but it was in vain. Yu Jong Mok knew everything, from one to ten. Yu Jong Mok smiled bitterly as Ju Seo Cheons face changed greatly and added some words. Even I dont know what it is exactly. But I could feel that you matured at some point but you were trying to hide it. No matter how fast a child grew, there was a limit to it. The result of having observed his disciple from up close was that his disciple was acting strangely. At first, he thought that he had felt a devil. There were cases where you turned crazy if your training in martial arts went wrong. It wasnt for nothing that masters stayed right next to their disciples to observe them. They would make mistakes at times because they were immature. But it seemed like that wasnt the case either. He had thought about it and made some hypotheses about it, but no logic worked through. He only thought that it was \u2018fine. You hid it because there are certain circumstances, right? Ju Seo Cheon nodded. If that is the case, there should also be a reason behind why you brought me this miraculous medicine. It cant be helped then. Yu Jong Mok embraced Ju Seo Cheon. Master\u2026Thank you. The disciple hugged his master tightly and then shed tears while leaning on his face. Yu Jong Mok patted Ju Seo Cheons back and cracked a joke. You pissed yourself down there and now you are also pissing from upwards. Master\u2026That is a bit\u2026. Sob! Ju Seo Cheon cried and then became serious. Yu Jong Mok became awkward when the joke he had prepared got rejected. \u2018I said that to make him laugh\u2026It didnt work? Ahh, master! It was also good to show off tight affection between master and disciple. But what was more important than that was applying the miraculous medicine. Ju Seo Cheon explained about the Water Spirit Fruit in detail so that Yu Jong Mok would be able to absorb the miraculous medicine better. Actually, there were no specific details in it. The only thing was that it had two properties, being water and wood. Then, I will ask you to protect me. Yu Jong Mok took in the Water Spirit Fruit and went to circulate his energy. \u2018Its amazing. He was able to feel the energy of the miraculous medicine when he closed his eyes and concentrated. It was also the first time for Yu Jong Mok to have applied a miraculous medicine. It wasnt that there were no miraculous medicines in a big sect like Mount Hua but they also werent overflowing with it to give it to anyone. Only a minority of prodigies were allowed to have miraculous medicines. But even them only took in at most one miraculous medicine in all their life. \u2018Right, lets keep\u2026. Huk? Yu Jong Mok got flustered while circulating his internal energy. Fortunately, he was able to keep his composure because he was controlling his emotions with the Taoist methods. \u2018What in the world happened? Yu Jong Mok had never taken in miraculous medicine before but he knew really well what he needed to do because of the manuals he had read. In the case you consumed a miraculous medicine, most of them circulated that energy to guide it into the dantian and pile it up like internal energy. But in the case that the energy of the miraculous medicine was enormous if you converted it into internal energy your vessels and dantian wouldnt be able to endure it and would explode. For that to not happen, they had to move it slowly and convert it little by little to make it their own. But what happened to Yu Jong Mok was completely different. In a really short instant, his qi moved on its own without him being able to do anything about it. His energy didnt explode. If that was the case, his organs would have gotten twisted and torn apart. The qi of the Water Spirit Fruit, the water, and wood energy entered deep into Yu Jong Moks body without him being able to act. \u2018Is the internal energy running rampant? His mind and consciousness trembled slightly. And the first thing he thought about was \u2018hes still nine years old\u2026 It was the face of his disciple, Ju Seo Cheon. He didnt doubt that the miraculous medicine came with defects. And he didnt even worry about his life or internal energy. He was only worried about his disciple. And then, at that moment. \u2018Huk! The water and wood energy that had disappeared entered a deeper part of his body. \u2018So that was the case! His worries and doubts disappeared. All the fog that had distorted his view also disappeared. And instead, he got able to realize something. But it wasnt insight in martial arts or an art. It was about his body that was relatively weak since he was young. \u2018So there was a problem with my vessel! The qi people were born with, the origin of life and another kind of great nature. This was called the vessel. Only that his vessel was a bit different from normal internal energy. First, the vessel was the origin of life. Spending this meant spending your life. The power of the vessel was so incredible that if you used it you would be able to obtain great strength, but you would die not long after that. Even if you didnt use all of it and someone managed to stay alive, you would still end up disabled or age drastically. Also, the power you spent wouldnt get replenished again. Using it would mark the end of you, no medicine could help you then. Yu Jong Mok had a problem in his vessel\u2026and for some reason, that medicine saved him even though it shouldnt have. \u2018Seo Cheon saved me, he saved me! Yu Jong Mok stood up from his seat abruptly. He wanted to hug his disciple hurriedly. Ju Seo Cheon got surprised as Yu Jong Mok got out of the room he was taking guard in a hurry after not even an hour passed. At first, he got worried that something may have gone wrong but he felt relieved at the laughter he heard after that. Yu Jong Mok embraced Ju Seo Cheon happily and when he finally managed to calm himself after a while he started to tell the changes in his body. Precisely speaking, it didnt seem like the vessel was the problem but the bowl that contained it. The bowl? Yu Jong Mok nodded at Ju Seo Cheons question. Right. It was faint but it seemed like my vessel was flowing out from somewhere. Even Ju Seo Cheon didnt know much about the vessel. That was the same in the past, the present, and in the future. There was nothing concrete that got revealed. Only the concept was transmitted down from long ago. They didnt even know where the vessel was located. It would flow out from somewhere when you wanted to use it after concentrating your mind about it, and it would get expended. The problem was that even the users could only think and feel it. They werent able to comprehend the logic behind it at all. That was the same for experts or small fries. Whatever the case, there was a problem in the bowl containing this vessel so his qi was being spent really minutely. That amount was the size of a hair thread, no, it was smaller than that. But even that amount gave a big influence in the body. It was an obvious thing as the origin of life got expended. It would be weirder if your body didnt show any problems. Even if you trained in martial arts to accumulate internal energy, that was a completely different boundary from the vessel so it couldnt get solved. \u2018Indeed, I barely know what happened. The vitality of the wood energy fixed the bowl of the vessel. Yu Jong Moko was able to understand what had happened despite the lack of information given by Ju Seo Cheon. Yu Jong Mok was teaching him diligently on the outside but Ju Seo Cheon already knew so much he could supplement his teachers teachings. In the first place, there was no way Ju Seo Cheon wouldnt know something Yu Jong Mok did as he was someone that had climbed to become an elder. \u2018Wood is life. Its not at the level of the vessel but the energy of the Spirit Water Fruit can replace it. So he complimented it with that. He had blocked what was flowing out so there was nothing to worry about now. It seemed like the Spirit Water Fruit also filled up what was already spent. To think that the wood energy replenished the life energy spent in the vessel! It had completely crushed the logic that it was never recoverable. \u2018It would not have been possible for others but it was possible indeed because it was master. Yu Jong Mok didnt use his vessel. If he had, he would have already died by now. The problem that had occurred in the bowl was really minute that not even he felt that a little bit of energy had flowed out. But even that small amount had to be recovered with the help of a peerless miraculous medicine like the Spirit Water Fruit. In addition, the energy of the Spirit Water Fruit was only used to fix the vessel. It couldnt be turned into internal energy. Yu Jong Mok only got healthy and he wasnt able to convert the energy of the miraculous medicine into internal energy at all. In the end, you arent able to use the vessel if you werent determined to die. Yu Jong Mok was also wary of this. Only that Yu Jong Mok was a really special case. \u2018Leave it. Thats not the important thing. The important thing was that the future had changed. There was nothing to worry about even if the fourteenth year passed. His master Yu Jong Mok wouldnt die. In the past, he had seen his master pass away hopelessly. He had lost his only beloved person, his only family. There were still many things he hadnt been able to learn. You should take this. The Water Spirit Fruit entered Ju Seo Cheons hand. Master! Dont tell me to take it just in case. I know my body more than anyone else. Your master is fine. Then, you should use it to accumulate internal energy\u2026 If that is the case, then you need it more than me. It seemed like Yu Jong Mok wouldnt yield either. Ju Seo Cheon tried to convince him a bit more but he had to resign after watching Yu Jong Moks strict face. Yu Jong Mok was boundlessly gentle and soft but he was so stubborn no one was able to stop him once he had decided to act. Ju Seo Cheon knew that better than anyone else. \u2018Right, okay. Lets not push it anymore. The disciple had conceded to the stubbornness of his master. I understand. You thought well. Only then did Yu Jong Mok start smiling again. A month later\u2026 The sun hadnt yet set. The outside was filled with white snow to the point it blinded you whilst the cold wind blew. The disciples were busy combing. Whew\u2026 Ju Seo Cheon opened his closed eyes slowly. \u2018I finally made it all my own. Ju Seo Cheon had taken in the Water Spirit Fruit one month ago. But the energy of the miraculous medicine was higher than he thought. He wasnt able to absorb it at once at the level he was at, with the body of a kid. Thats why he had to invest a month to absorb the energy slowly so that there were no aftereffects in his body. That internal energy was worth half of a sexagenary cycle. Half of a sexagenary cycle, that meant it was thirty years! To accumulate thirty years worth of internal energy in only one month! Adding up his two and a half years worth of internal energy and another half a years worth of energy of having circulated the Plum Blossom Life Arts for one month amounted to a total of thirty-three years. How unfortunate. Ju Seo Cheon smacked his lips. The energy the Water Spirit Fruit had was really incredible. Perhaps But unfortunately, his body wasnt able to keep up. If you kept pouring water to a bowl it would one day overflow. It was the same with the dantian. It was still too small to absorb all the energy of the Water Spirit Fruit and so he wasnt able to make the sixty years worth of internal energy his. \u2018But its not like I threw it away, so lets be satisfied with this. He had instead invested it in his blood vessels. He strengthened them so that the passageways wouldnt collapse. But the problem was that doing so caused him a bit of pain. Originally, he had to expand them in a certain order but it happened because he expanded them in an instant. He didnt suffer internal injuries thanks to having used the wood energy that had a particularly strong recovery and regenerative power. Whew, I finally completed the Plum Blossom Qi Arts. The reason it stagnated at the tenth star was that he lacked internal energy. With the increase of internal energy his limits also naturally increased. You finally made the energy in the miraculous medicine to be yours. Every day would have been an ordeal, you are really amazing. Yu Jong Mok, who was standing guard, praised him. In the past month, he had taken attention to his masters health. But after consuming the medicine he didnt show any signs of coughing or being sick. But only a month passed so he couldnt be fully sure about it. He was still observing him. Mm, thirty years\u2026 Yu Jong Mok sensed the pulse of his disciple and let out a sigh of exclamation. The miraculous medicine is impressive indeed. It wasnt normal to possess this much internal energy when you were only nine. It was the same in Mount Hua Sect and other great sects. In the case of noble families, if there was only one person that would continue the generation, they would be able to support that person with miraculous medicines regardless of their age. But excluding those special cases, they werent able to hand over miraculous medicines carelessly. Thats why they would first thoroughly check their talent on martial arts and the temperament of a person after they become an adult. It was a thing that was that hard to obtain so it was really strange to see a young kid overflowing with this much internal energy. Good, if its this much you should be able to start the enhancement gymnastics with your master. Lets start training with me starting from today. Enhancement gymnastics\u2026? Ju Seo Cheon tilted his head at the unknown words. He may not be able to remember those words or it was the first time hearing it but those words werent in his memories before returning in time. Yu Jong Mok smiled back softly at him and explained. Its a gymnastics variant I came up with to try to fix this weak constitution. The name is something I just came up with, and you can think of it as a kind of physical training. In the past, Yu Jong Mok had worked harder than anyone else to try to fix his body that was less healthy than others. That effort continued even after he fell out of being a Plum Blossom Sword Examiner. Because of that, he pursued various methods and one of them was the self-developed health enhancement gymnastics. \u2018But he didnt teach me that in my past life\u2026? Ju Seo Cheons doubts soon got cleared by Yu Jong Mok. Your body has thirty-three years worth of internal energy sleeping. Its an incredible amount. In addition, Yu Jong Mok didnt know about the Plum Blossom Life Arts. He thought that the thirty-two years worth of internal energy came from consuming the miraculous medicine. But you cant see that as being the only thing you need. \u2018Huh? What does he mean? Ju Seo Cheon got awe struck at Yu Jong Moks remark. He had worked really hard to absorb the energy in the miraculous medicine and use it efficiently. He had recalled all the memories of his past so he couldnt help but tilt his head when Yu Jong Mok remarked that it wasnt good. He felt really sorry for his master that was like the sky, but Ju Seo Cheon was several times higher when it came to martial arts. There is a saying in Murim that goes \u2018A healthy qi in a healthy body. Healthy qi would permeate in a healthy body. That meant the harmony between internal energy and the body. Balance is an important thing. The body of a person is more delicate than you think, so if the balance breaks even a little it will get destroyed. That is the same for your body. \u2018Aha! Only then did Ju Seo Cheon nod in understanding. It wasnt that he gained insight into something he didnt know about. He obviously knew about it. \u2018I cant say that I already know all of that. There was no way Ju Seo Cheon didnt know something important like that. Training his body was something he was planning to do slowly. \u2018Um, indeed.

It seems like I should sneak out to train alone. In the first place, masters version of gymnastics was designed for a person with a weak body. He had doubts about how much that would help him. \u2018Would it be hard? Ju Seo Cheon looked at Yu Jong Mok and smiled like a fool\u2026 The fourth day of having started the enhancement gymnastics. People tend to make regrets. Regardless of age or gender. It was the same for Ju Seo Cheon. He cursed himself for having smiled like a fool four days ago. He cursed and cried many times for having thought it would be easy. \u2018Graaaaaaaagh! Terrible pain was felt in all his body. This level of pain was one of the greatest he felt even in his past life. No, perhaps it may be the first time he felt this. \u2018Something is wrong. Ju Seo Cheon fell in his thoughts at the pain that was transmitted in his arms, no, in his entire body. His bones creaked and his muscles seemed to tear apart. Some of his nails already broke and his hands were filled with blisters. The pain that followed that was no joke. Four days ago was when he started with the enhancement gymnastics. At first, it was simple gymnastics. He warmed up like Yu Jong Mok taught him to. It really was simple gymnastics. After that, he had to make a roundtrip using the Light Step Arts. He consumed his internal energy in an instant as he did as he was told to. After that, he got complimented by Yu Jong Mok and got dragged somewhere. It was below a cliff. Now, climb up. \u2026 We will start daily update next week Donate $ on Kofi and mention Volcanic Age for keep our release speed!

Mount Hua was called the Five Peaks of the Midlands and was praised as a spiritual mountain. Its appearance was so impressive that anyone looking at it up close would lose their souls. But all beautiful roses tend to have thorns. Mount Hua was a spiritual mountain that was also famous for being steep, so people wouldnt even attempt to climb it if they werent martial artists. The Lotus Peak, where Hua Sect was located, was comparatively easier to climb because a path was already made on it. But it wasnt the same for the other regions. It was hard to even endure on these peaks if you werent at least a second-rated martial artist. And Ju Seo Cheon was currently climbing the steep cliff that he couldnt even see the shape or peak of. Hang in there a little bit more. You feel like this because its your first time but believe me, its not that big of a deal! The voice of his master was heard from above. \u2018Its not a big deal? Ju Seo Cheon stuck close to the cliff and gulped. Tremble. All ten of his fingers got cut while climbing. Bloodstains were left everywhere and the wounds only increased every time he moved his hands. A wound like this wasnt that important. All his body ached so he couldnt even speak. Strength entered his core along with nervousness. But he couldnt release the strength as it wouldnt be a smart move. If he did that and accidentally broke a handhold , he would fall down and his body\u2026SPLAT. If he had stimulated his internal energy while climbing, he would have endured it. But he couldnt as he was supposed to climb the peak without using it. He was about to go crazy. It was hard, exhausting and every part of his body hurt. There was no part in his body that wasnt in pain. This training was harsh. No, in the first place it was weird to push a nine-year-old kid to the limits like this. Even if he had more internal energy than others, he didnt think that his master would make him climb a cliff. This whole thing was completely wrong. \u2018I didnt think properly! Ju Seo Cheon regretted having thought of the enhancement gymnastics lightly. He had thought that it would only be warming up because it was gymnastics created by a weak person to get healthier. But his way of thinking itself was wrong. Smiling gentle sword, Yu Jong Mok He had to realize what kind of person his master was. Yu Jong Mok was a person that became a candidate for the Plum Blossom Sword Examiner even though he had a body that was several times weaker than the others. He didnt climb to that place solely through talent. He needed to exert many times more effort than others. He couldnt fix his constitution, so he still worked hard more than anyone else to compensate for that. Looking at the results, he had to give up on the seat of the Plum Blossom Sword Examiner but that didnt mean that his efforts and skills disappeared. In reality, the evaluation the Mount Hua Sect had on Yu Jong Mok was quite high and they were all the more disappointed because of that. Whatever the case, would a person with that kind of constitution be able to compensate for it with an easy solution? Obviously not. Grrr! He let out a superhuman roar and started to climb up again. His body and mind was screaming at him to stop immediately. \u2018What an absurd level of intensity\u2026! The respect he had towards his master surged up. Climbing up a cliff with no internal energy. The effects were certainly good. In the case of martial artists, they used internal energy to lessen the burden and pain on their body. It was because using internal energy would protect the functions of their bodies. But if that happened, the training wouldnt progress properly. For reference, the body would only get a step stronger after it got broken, torn apart, and then pieced back together. Its endurance would evolve the more it was hit, just like steel. That meant that climbing the steep cliff was the most optimal environment to train your body. If he let go of the tension or lost strength even by a little he would die because he had spent all his internal energy so he could only keep putting strength. His muscles would naturally get trained because of the burden and he had to use strength constantly. This was the perfect training regime. Ju Seo Cheon had made three excuses. Master, I will really die like this. The first is that he only had one life. Im only nine years old. Im at a phase where I should be growing lots so I think that this is too much. The second one was that his body was still that of a kid. There may be a problem in his growth if he overdid it. Oh, you asked a really good question. Its fine. Your body has internal energy beyond imagination hiding inside so that part you asked about will be solved when you circulate your energy. Thats because internal energy is life itself. \u2018Did I get busted\u2026 Ju Seo Cheon also knew that much. There was no way his master didnt know about it. No, contrary to that what he was thinking about was beyond Yu Jong Moks thoughts. The growth stimulation and regenerative abilities he absorbed from the Plum Blossom was perfect. And the third one. Master, help me once. Its really difficult. I feel like crying for real. That it was terribly hard. Pain that would even make the toughest person give up. The second point wasnt that important but this one was as important as the first one. If I were to relax even a little I would die. There is nothing to say about the mental oppression and there is also the physical pain. It was a really harsh training that made his body and mind get completely exhausted. Being able to achieve this wasnt normal at all. \u2018Fuck it. He felt like tears would fall down. The original Ju Seo Cheon wasnt someone desperate or someone that worked hard. He somehow managed to stay alive by a stroke of luck and also became one of the Five Elders because of that luck. His personality remained the same even after he returned in time. In the first place, having been able to cultivate the Plum Blossom Life Arts was due to being able to keep his memories. That was why he was able to get greater results than others with less effort and mental consumption in the first place. He only struggled desperately in the case of the Water Spirit Fruit because that was the only way to save his master. Ju Seo Cheon, the one that admired the heroes from the age of war was far from being able to be one. Right, it should really be hard\u2026 Yu Jong Mok looked down at his disciple and put on a sad expression. His eyes got wet with tears and trembled. Master\u2026! Ju Seo Cheon looked at Yu Jong Moks face and smiled brightly. But that is only a momentary pain, that pain shall also pass. What? Ju Seo Cheon doubted his ears. I also thought about it several times while climbing that part. But I somehow managed to climb it while gritting my teeth. You will also be able to succeed safely. Yu Jong Mok clenched his fist like telling him to cheer up and smiled softly like usual. \u2026Ah. Ju Seo Cheon despaired while looking at that smile. \u2018Master, you\u2026you were that kind of person\u2026! There was a saying in Kang Ho that went like this. Dont say that what you are able to do, others will also be able to. Whether they are martial artists or not, everyone has a different limit. I can do it so you can also do it. It was one of the teachings that can be considered to be bad. But of course, in this case Ju Seo Cheon was better than Yu Jong Mok. At that time, Yu Jong Mok didnt have a more superior internal energy than his peers and also didnt have the body or mentality thanks to that. But his will was different. He climbed the cliff without the help of others. That by itself wasnt something that could be done by anyone. It was a really impressive thing. Not even Ju Seo Cheon would be able to act like that in his past life. His efforts were outstanding even in the Mount Hua Sect. He was the complete opposite of Ju Seo Cheon. I cant do it. Its fine! I will stay with you even if it becomes night or dawn! If you are hungry let us eat at the cliff together. Eat together. Together\u2026. Gether\u2026. Huk! Ju Seo Cheon turned pale. The echo of his masters voice made some pebbles fall down his head. \u2018I really dont want to think this. Ju Seo Cheon put on a teary face. \u2018But master is really bad at teaching! Yu Jong Moks personality was correct. It was really upright. But speaking in other words, he had no know-how of teaching and was simple and honest. That meant that he was someone that had the way of thinking of \u2018you will somehow be able to do it with effort, passion, and willpower! \u2018Ahh, my master is so human! He was given talent and willpower but instead received a weak constitution. He had an outstanding personality and nature but instead received a simple-minded brain. Im really sorry. I didnt want to give you pain like this. But if I left you alone, you will surely turn lazy because of that vast internal energy. Yu Jong Mok felt sincerely hurt while looking at his only disciple climb up the cliff. Originally, he wanted to help his disciple immediately as he was someone with a lot of affection and wasnt ruthless at all. Its fine. Thinking about it, I think that I can be a bit lazy. Am I not already a step ahead, master? Ju Seo Cheon spoke in an anxious manner. No, that cant happen for your future. Please, forgive this master of yours. No, rather you should hate me No, master. Im really fine. I was the one in the wrong. I wont live lazily so I hope we can find another method together. Help me once master. Strength started to leave his hands. He had rested for too long and he really hated to think that he would have to climb up again. \u2018This is the punishment given to the disciple that didnt even know about his master before returning in time! He could have never imagined that he had a side like this. No, it was understandable that he didnt know. Before returning in time, Ju Seo Cheon was already fulfilled just by catching up with regular training while Yu Jong Mok wasnt that healthy. Thats why Yu Jong Mok wasnt able to train Ju Seo Cheon like this. It, its really hard. I will die like this. Ju Seo Cheons voice became urgent. Its fine if you resent me for not being to help you. Thats why the two of us should cheer up. I believe in you. Yu Jong Mok put on a teary face and smiled faintly. His smile resembled that of Yuanshi Tianzun. The mist in the surroundings disappeared, the clouds cleared up and it shone on him like a streak of light shining inside the darkness. Ju Seo Cheon saw that smile and thought. \u2018Fucked\u2026Im so fucked\u2026","title":"volcanic-9"},{"location":"volcanic-9/#vocanic-age-chapter-9","text":"Editor: Summerstood, Imagine Ju Seo Cheon doubted his ears at that moment. Mount Hua was called the Five Peaks of the Midlands and was praised as a spiritual mountain. Its appearance was so impressive that anyone looking at it up close would lose their souls. But all beautiful roses tend to have thorns. Mount Hua was a spiritual mountain that was also famous for being steep, so people wouldnt even attempt to climb it if they werent martial artists. The Lotus Peak, where Hua Sect was located, was comparatively easier to climb because a path was already made on it. But it wasnt the same for the other regions. It was hard to even endure on these peaks if you werent at least a second-rated martial artist. And Ju Seo Cheon was currently climbing the steep cliff that he couldnt even see the shape or peak of. Hang in there a little bit more. You feel like this because its your first time but believe me, its not that big of a deal! The voice of his master was heard from above. \u2018Its not a big deal? Ju Seo Cheon stuck close to the cliff and gulped. Tremble. All ten of his fingers got cut while climbing. Bloodstains were left everywhere and the wounds only increased every time he moved his hands. A wound like this wasnt that important. All his body ached so he couldnt even speak. Strength entered his core along with nervousness. But he couldnt release the strength as it wouldnt be a smart move. If he did that and accidentally broke a handhold , he would fall down and his body\u2026SPLAT. If he had stimulated his internal energy while climbing, he would have endured it. But he couldnt as he was supposed to climb the peak without using it. He was about to go crazy. It was hard, exhausting and every part of his body hurt. There was no part in his body that wasnt in pain. This training was harsh. No, in the first place it was weird to push a nine-year-old kid to the limits like this. Even if he had more internal energy than others, he didnt think that his master would make him climb a cliff. This whole thing was completely wrong. \u2018I didnt think properly! Ju Seo Cheon regretted having thought of the enhancement gymnastics lightly. He had thought that it would only be warming up because it was gymnastics created by a weak person to get healthier. But his way of thinking itself was wrong. Smiling gentle sword, Yu Jong Mok He had to realize what kind of person his master was. Yu Jong Mok was a person that became a candidate for the Plum Blossom Sword Examiner even though he had a body that was several times weaker than the others. He didnt climb to that place solely through talent. He needed to exert many times more effort than others. He couldnt fix his constitution, so he still worked hard more than anyone else to compensate for that. Looking at the results, he had to give up on the seat of the Plum Blossom Sword Examiner but that didnt mean that his efforts and skills disappeared. In reality, the evaluation the Mount Hua Sect had on Yu Jong Mok was quite high and they were all the more disappointed because of that. Whatever the case, would a person with that kind of constitution be able to compensate for it with an easy solution? Obviously not. Grrr! He let out a superhuman roar and started to climb up again. His body and mind was screaming at him to stop immediately. \u2018What an absurd level of intensity\u2026! The respect he had towards his master surged up. Climbing up a cliff with no internal energy. The effects were certainly good. In the case of martial artists, they used internal energy to lessen the burden and pain on their body. It was because using internal energy would protect the functions of their bodies. But if that happened, the training wouldnt progress properly. For reference, the body would only get a step stronger after it got broken, torn apart, and then pieced back together. Its endurance would evolve the more it was hit, just like steel. That meant that climbing the steep cliff was the most optimal environment to train your body. If he let go of the tension or lost strength even by a little he would die because he had spent all his internal energy so he could only keep putting strength. His muscles would naturally get trained because of the burden and he had to use strength constantly. This was the perfect training regime. Ju Seo Cheon had made three excuses. Master, I will really die like this. The first is that he only had one life. Im only nine years old. Im at a phase where I should be growing lots so I think that this is too much. The second one was that his body was still that of a kid. There may be a problem in his growth if he overdid it. Oh, you asked a really good question. Its fine. Your body has internal energy beyond imagination hiding inside so that part you asked about will be solved when you circulate your energy. Thats because internal energy is life itself. \u2018Did I get busted\u2026 Ju Seo Cheon also knew that much. There was no way his master didnt know about it. No, contrary to that what he was thinking about was beyond Yu Jong Moks thoughts. The growth stimulation and regenerative abilities he absorbed from the Plum Blossom was perfect. And the third one. Master, help me once. Its really difficult. I feel like crying for real. That it was terribly hard. Pain that would even make the toughest person give up. The second point wasnt that important but this one was as important as the first one. If I were to relax even a little I would die. There is nothing to say about the mental oppression and there is also the physical pain. It was a really harsh training that made his body and mind get completely exhausted. Being able to achieve this wasnt normal at all. \u2018Fuck it. He felt like tears would fall down. The original Ju Seo Cheon wasnt someone desperate or someone that worked hard. He somehow managed to stay alive by a stroke of luck and also became one of the Five Elders because of that luck. His personality remained the same even after he returned in time. In the first place, having been able to cultivate the Plum Blossom Life Arts was due to being able to keep his memories. That was why he was able to get greater results than others with less effort and mental consumption in the first place. He only struggled desperately in the case of the Water Spirit Fruit because that was the only way to save his master. Ju Seo Cheon, the one that admired the heroes from the age of war was far from being able to be one. Right, it should really be hard\u2026 Yu Jong Mok looked down at his disciple and put on a sad expression. His eyes got wet with tears and trembled. Master\u2026! Ju Seo Cheon looked at Yu Jong Moks face and smiled brightly. But that is only a momentary pain, that pain shall also pass. What? Ju Seo Cheon doubted his ears. I also thought about it several times while climbing that part. But I somehow managed to climb it while gritting my teeth. You will also be able to succeed safely. Yu Jong Mok clenched his fist like telling him to cheer up and smiled softly like usual. \u2026Ah. Ju Seo Cheon despaired while looking at that smile. \u2018Master, you\u2026you were that kind of person\u2026! There was a saying in Kang Ho that went like this. Dont say that what you are able to do, others will also be able to. Whether they are martial artists or not, everyone has a different limit. I can do it so you can also do it. It was one of the teachings that can be considered to be bad. But of course, in this case Ju Seo Cheon was better than Yu Jong Mok. At that time, Yu Jong Mok didnt have a more superior internal energy than his peers and also didnt have the body or mentality thanks to that. But his will was different. He climbed the cliff without the help of others. That by itself wasnt something that could be done by anyone. It was a really impressive thing. Not even Ju Seo Cheon would be able to act like that in his past life. His efforts were outstanding even in the Mount Hua Sect. He was the complete opposite of Ju Seo Cheon. I cant do it. Its fine! I will stay with you even if it becomes night or dawn! If you are hungry let us eat at the cliff together. Eat together. Together\u2026. Gether\u2026. Huk! Ju Seo Cheon turned pale. The echo of his masters voice made some pebbles fall down his head. \u2018I really dont want to think this. Ju Seo Cheon put on a teary face. \u2018But master is really bad at teaching! Yu Jong Moks personality was correct. It was really upright. But speaking in other words, he had no know-how of teaching and was simple and honest. That meant that he was someone that had the way of thinking of \u2018you will somehow be able to do it with effort, passion, and willpower! \u2018Ahh, my master is so human! He was given talent and willpower but instead received a weak constitution. He had an outstanding personality and nature but instead received a simple-minded brain. Im really sorry. I didnt want to give you pain like this. But if I left you alone, you will surely turn lazy because of that vast internal energy. Yu Jong Mok felt sincerely hurt while looking at his only disciple climb up the cliff. Originally, he wanted to help his disciple immediately as he was someone with a lot of affection and wasnt ruthless at all. Its fine. Thinking about it, I think that I can be a bit lazy.

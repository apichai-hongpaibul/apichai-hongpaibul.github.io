<p>Editor: Imagine
Zhuge Seung Kye had hidden himself as soon as he heard news that the River of Death was attacking them.
 Due to this People thought that he had gotten scared and hid himself.</p>
<p>But that wasnt the case at all.
 It was the opposite.
 Rather than hiding, Zhuge Seung Kye gathered objects like arrows and bamboo barrels to make an assassination weapon.
 An, an assassination weapon? Mak Won Gap got bewildered.</p>
<p>‘The Sichuan Family? It was a weapon he had never seen or heard of before.
 The only people that would use that kind of assassination weapon were the ones that belonged to the Sichuan Family.</p>
<p>Haha, its a success! A success! Zhuge Seung Kye jumped in joy and cheered.</p>
<p>Well done Zhuge Seung Kye! Ju Seo Cheon called out Zhuge Seung Kyes name out loud on purpose.
 It was so that everyone in the surroundings was able to hear him.</p>
<p>The Zhuge family? Mak Won Gap asked back with a surprised face.</p>
<p>No, why would the Zhuge Sega use assassination weapons?
The Righteous Faction considered that using assassination tools was a disgrace, except for the Sichuan Family.</p>
<p>Even if it wasnt practicing it and helping others use it, the four factions penalized it greatly.</p>
<p>Huk! Th, they saw me!
Zhuge Seung Kye stopped jumping in joy and got bewildered.</p>
<p>This was the first time he had gotten so much attention that he felt his hands tremble and his heart sink.</p>
<p>Cold sweat dripped from his forehead and his mind turned white.</p>
<p>Wh, what are you looking at! I also know that im useless! His negative way of thinking had returned.</p>
<p>Zhuge Seung Kye embraced the bamboo crossbow and got teary.
 It was a hard situation for a kid that was only ten.</p>
<p>In addition, he hadnt trained in martial arts properly so he wasnt able to hold it when the warriors of the River of Death looked at him menacingly.</p>
<p>For the Zhuge Sega to use assassination weapons, how cowardly! You should be ashamed! Mak Won Gaps eyes turned red and yelled.</p>
<p>Hah.
 The second rate warrior of Weng An looked at Mak Won Gap dumbfoundedly and the third rate warriors also showed similar reactions to him.</p>
<p>The River of Death was a group that didnt care about honor if it meant winning.</p>
<p>But Mak Won Gap didnt care about their gazes and continued to criticize Zhuge Seung Kye.</p>
<p>Dont fight like that from up there and lets have a fair square fight!
‘Thats dangerous.</p>
<p>Mak Won Gap got cautious of the bamboo crossbow.
 The warriors that got fired a while ago werent life threatening but it was still troublesome.</p>
<p>He didnt have the leisure to mind those arrows.
 If he did, he would have been killed by Ju Seo Cheon.</p>
<p>‘In addition, martial artists of the Righteous Faction would give up their heads by their own if you tell them its cowardly.
 Theres no way he wont fall for it.</p>
<p>Mak Won Gap was sure of it.</p>
<p>Wasnt it you who came to attack a small group with a big one? Now youre pointing out what is right and wrong.
 Have some shame.
 Ju Seo Cheon stepped forward as if that wouldnt work and smirked.
 Seung Kye, it has become certain with this.
 You are clearly a genius.
 Thats why you should serve me as your older brother.
 You are spouting nonsense again.
 Zhuge Seung Kye put on a tired expression.</p>
<p>Attack! Mak Won Gaps voice rang resonantly.</p>
<p>A third rate warrior holding a sword charged towards him.
 He had quite a confident expression but he was so slow it made Ju Seo Cheon yawn.</p>
<p>Die! The third rate warrior yelled energetically and swung his sword.
 Ju Seo Cheon took a step to his left and dodged it lightly.</p>
<p>‘Plum Blossom Brilliant Sword Art!
Ju Seo Cheons blade moved so fast that to the average warrior it had simply disappeared.</p>
<p>Huk!
The third rate warrior stared at the sword with a surprised look but it was too late.
 Great pain was felt in his solar plexus and blood poured out.</p>
<p>This brat! This time two warriors attacked him from both sides.
 Ju Seo Cheon held his sword more tightly and got satisfied.</p>
<p>‘I have been training constantly so I was worried if I wasnt able to use it in real combat, so Im glad that isnt the case.</p>
<p>He had succeeded in the Fourteen Stances of the Plum Blossom Sword and the Plum Blossom Brilliant Sword Art without much problems.
 This time, Ju Seo Cheon took a defensive posture and executed the Five Elements Plum Blossom Sword Art.</p>
<p>The Five Elements Plum Blossom Sword Art, that contained the five elements, was a martial art that circulated defensive and offensive attacks naturally.</p>
<p>It was a sword technique that immediately let you attack after having defended.</p>
<p>The sharp sound of wind being split was heard from both sides and swords came flying towards him.
 However, Ju Seo Cheon lightly fended them off.</p>
<p>Ugh! A third rate warrior couldnt hold his weight and fell to his right and the other third rate warrior that was attacking from the right got bewildered.</p>
<p>One.
 He swung his sword horizontally and cleanly cut off the heads of the warriors that were at his right.</p>
<p>Ju Seo Cheon twisted his wrist and grabbed his sword inversely to stab the back of the falling warrior.</p>
<p>He could feel a life being cut off followed by a groan from his sword.</p>
<p>Hi, hiiik! The warriors of the River of Death hesitated.
 Their faces were now filled with fear rather than excitement.</p>
<p>And Ju Seo Cheon didnt miss that opportunity.
 He charged towards them and entered their grasp.</p>
<p>Uaaagh! Kuak! The sword containing the plum blossom danced in the air.
 Its execution was perfect, it was as tranquil and serene as it should be yet it delivered a powerful attack.
 At times, it seemed like a butterfly was fluttering its wings but soon turned into a fierce storm to threaten the warriors of the River of Death.</p>
<p>Their heads got separated from their bodies and a hole got pierced in their chests and blood poured down from it.</p>
<p>‘Is it really his first time in Kang Ho?
The second rate warrior of Weng An got thrilled by Ju Seo Cheons strength.
 He had a face that he couldnt believe what he was seeing.</p>
<p>Based on his information, Ju Seo Cheon was only twelve.
 A kid that was only twelve years old didnt have any hesitation at all in his first battle.
 It was to the point that he felt a bit of alienation.</p>
<p>Come! Ju Seo Cheon shook off the blood in his sword and yelled.</p>
<p>I am Ju Seo Cheon, of the Mount Hua sect!
Ju Seo Cheon of the Mount Hua Sect!
He got goosebumps in all his body and felt thrilled.</p>
<p>He had never yelled this confidently in his past life.
 He only followed others when they yelled.</p>
<p>But that wasnt the case now.
 The warriors were following his back.
 It didnt matter that they were third rate.</p>
<p>They believed in him and were looking at his back.
 This moment was one that he wouldnt be able to forget.</p>
<p>Waaaa!
The warriors of the Murim Association cheered.
 It was the opposite of how they were a while ago.</p>
<p>There was a difference in numbers that was twice as large but they had a young expert here.
 They believed in that.</p>
<p>Even if an allied warrior got stabbed in their chests, they didnt feel fear and counterattacked.</p>
<p>Theres no need to push yourselves so just do what I told you to! Ju Seo Cheon yelled towards the warriors of the Murim Association.</p>
<p>Before the warriors of the River of Death destroyed the gate, he had told them to induce the enemy warriors to his side.
 Most of them disapproved of his words but now they were following it in earnest.</p>
<p>The warriors of the Murim Association basically focused on defense and at the same time sent the warriors towards Ju Seo Cheon.</p>
<p>Ju Seo Cheon flew off swiftly when an enemy entered his, even if it was only by a little, and inflicted a blow.</p>
<p>Kuaaagh! The thirty warriors that had first entered the gate decreased exponentially.</p>
<p>Then, the enemy warriors that were holding in wait in a relaxed manner also entered inside the gates and an additional thirty people arrived.</p>
<p>The warriors of the River of Death, that numberd a hundred in the beginning, decreased to fifty.</p>
<p>A pile of corpses started to accumulate in front of the gate to the point that it disturbed in entering the gate.</p>
<p>The path got blocked for the enemy warriors that were only third rate so it became harder to fight.
 Ju Seo Cheon roamed freely as if he didnt care about that at all and executed sword dances.</p>
<p>Take this!
The most annoying thing was Zhuge Seung Kye, who was at the rear.
 There werent that many bamboo crossbows because he made them in a hurry but it obstructed them every time they wanted to pass over the warriors of the Murim Association.</p>
<p>Ju Seo Cheon noticed that like a ghost everytime that happened and swung his sword swiftly to take the lives of the warriors.</p>
<p>The battle in this place was at a low level compared to the battle taking place in Kaiyan, that was half a day away from this place, but it was still fine.</p>
<p>The members that could enter through the gate were limited, and formed a solid defensive formation to take away the lives of the enemies.</p>
<p>Da, damn it!
When the situation started to flow in an unexpected way, Mak Won Gap rolled his eyes quickly and looked furtively for a chance to escape.</p>
<p>He was afraid of trouble that would occur if he escaped but he didnt see any hope if they continued like this.</p>
<p>It seemed like it was the same for the other warriors of the River of Death, that their eyes that were filled with gold at the beginning started to turn and change with fear.</p>
<p>Just what in the world are you doing! Mak Won Gaps panicked voice rang in the battlefield.</p>
<p>And what are you supposed to be doing?
Ju Seo Cheon walked towards Mak Won Gap and everyone trembled at that even though he wasnt particularly aggressive.</p>
<p>Hes putting on airs, Im sure of it.
 Im certain that hes exhausted as he has been fighting until now.
 Mak Won Gap mumbled to himself as if trying to fall into self hypnosis.
 That would be right in ordinary cases.</p>
<p>Ju Seo Cheon nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>But Im not.
 Im sorry to take away your hopes but my nickname as the flashy yet frail is quite the misconception you see.
 Ju Seo Cheon smiled brightly without even dropping a drop of sweat.
 That smile looked like it belonged to the devil for Mak Won Gap.</p>
<p>Don, dont get any closer! Mak Won Gap yelled with a scared voice, this fear affected the other enemy warriors.</p>
<p>Even if that wasnt the case, they were already scared of Ju Seo Cheon for having killed close to fifty warriors in an instant.</p>
<p>Everyone else lost their fighting spirit as the commander and the strongest of them showed fright.</p>
<p>Es, escape! Uaaagh!
One person escaped and that spread to the others like a disease.
 Everyone let out scared voices and escaped.</p>
<p>Damn it! In the end Mak Won Gap also had to give up.
 He couldnt do anything about his members that became uncontrollable.</p>
<p>He pushed away the warriors of the River of Death with force and tried to escape.</p>
<p>Get away! Im getting away first!
Mak Won Gaps voice rang in the battlefield.</p>
<p>No, you cant leave.</p>
<p>He closed the distance with Mak Won Gap as if the corpses spread on the floor didnt obstruct him at all.</p>
<p>Mak Won Gap got grabbed by his collar after having only advanced a few meters.</p>
<p>Oh my, great master! Im sorry for not having recognized you!
Mak Won Gap screamed pitifully as soon as he got grabbed.
 He dropped his sword to the floor as if he didnt even want to resist.</p>
<p>‘I dont know how this happened but this kid is a kid I cant do anything against.
 I have to find a way to live.</p>
<p>He had completely lost his will to fight after seeing how Ju Seo Cheon fought.
 He was an opponent he couldnt defeat at all.</p>
<p>His judgement was as fast as lightning as he became certain of it.</p>
<p>Mak Won Gap threw away his pride and lowered his pride to continue living.</p>
<p>You have to keep on living so I can hear the details from you, so you will need to stay here.
 I dont know much, great master.
 Its more comfortable if you leave me be.
 Things like thi… Really? I should kill you then.
 I will answer whatever you want! Starting from this moment, I am going to follow great master! </p>

<p>&lt; Second S-Rank (2) .<br />
-Chiiiik[1 Against the super fancy[2 marbling, the chuck flap tail[3 made a delicious sound as it was lowered onto the grill.<br />
Next to it, Korean beef tripe was puffed up and sizzling with fat.<br />
The world was definitely worth living in.<br />
It would be great to have a bottle of soju or beer but it wasn’t right for this situation.  </p>
<p>You can drink alcohol.<br />
…Hm.<br />
Your face looks like you really want to drink.<br />
I’ve seen drunk people everyday so you don’t have to worry.<br />
……Was my face too obvious or could she read minds?.<br />
I can’t get drunk when we have to talk about the contract.<br />
And the person in front of me is a formidable opponent.<br />
I’m afraid I’ll get robbed if I get drunk, so I can’t.<br />
Rather than me being formidable, isn’t it that ahjussi[4 is too soft?Bak Yerim smiled delightedly.<br />
It seemed like her grumbling mood had loosened.<br />
To make it easy to talk, we deliberately went into a room so there weren’t other customers nearby.<br />
In the first place, the time was a little awkward so there weren’t a lot of customers at all.<br />
Kim Sunghan refused the proposal to each together, and after carefully looking around the inside of the restaurant, he went outside, saying he would wait there.<br />
I should just give up on making that person an S-Rank.<br />
We weren’t getting close at all.  </p>
<p>Anyways, did you really know my parents?Bak Yerim asked, picking up a piece of meat.  </p>
<p>If we didn’t know each other, how would I have been able find you right away.<br />
We didn’t know each other well, but I was once indebted to them when I was young.<br />
When you were young.<br />
Yeah.<br />
I lost my parents early too.<br />
Trying to survive while taking care of my young dongsaeng was difficult.<br />
com for the best novel reading experience I was running myself ragged trying to sell the story.<br />
But this was something emotionally moving for Koreans – tragic circumstances of losing parents early in life and having no one to turn to, etcetera.<br />
Even with just sympathy votes from losing your parents, you could become the president.  </p>
<p>Back then, your parents gave us a little help.<br />
That was already around 10 years ago so you probably don’t remember.<br />
Of course, I didn’t remember either.<br />
Pouring a cup of cider, instead of alcohol, I continued speaking.  </p>
<p>Before Awakening, I was busy with just surviving so I didn’t have time to think about looking.<br />
I had an S-Rank Awakened Person as a dongsaeng but until recently our relationship wasn’t good.<br />
Really? Now that I think of it, I don’t think I’ve ever heard about Haeyeon Guild Leader’s family.<br />
We made up a few days ago.<br />
I Awakened, and got a useful skill, and made up with my dongsaeng.<br />
With things settling down, I remembered past things.<br />
It’s a little selfish, right.<br />
What do you mean selfish.<br />
Just look at my uncle! There are a lot of people who repay good with evil, so remembering even a while later is better at least.<br />
Bak Yerim said, puffing out her cheeks.<br />
The inside of those cheeks was full with well-stuffed meat-ssam[5.<br />
She eats well.  </p>
<p>Hey, that’s chili.<br />
com for the best novel reading experience.<br />
I like spicy things.<br />
Saying that, she even dipped raw garlic[6 in ssamjang[7 and ate it.<br />
Just how many pieces of garlic did she put in her ssam.<br />
If it wasn’t cooked, I would get heartburn, so I couldn’t eat it.  </p>
<p>So I asked around and found you.<br />
At first, I was just going to ask if you needed help with anything, but your Awakening aptitude was really outstanding.<br />
Euaeeuuh.<br />
Speak after you swallow.<br />
Did that bastard uncle starve his niece or something.  </p>
<p>Then all I have to do now is sign the contract with ahjussi.<br />
Yeah.<br />
Awakening can be right away or might take a few days according to the situation.<br />
It won’t take long.<br />
It’d be good if it’s right away.<br />
When I get home, it’ll be a huge fuss.<br />
About half is luck but I’ll try.<br />
How do I say the keyword.<br />
Should I speak more about parents? First, I took out a contract from my inventory.<br />
Bak Yerim’s eyes became round at seeing parchment appearing out of the air.  </p>
<p>That’s the inventory, right? This is actually my first time seeing it.<br />
You’ll also get one soon.<br />
You can only put in dungeon-related things, but it’s convenient.<br />
You couldn’t put in normal things.<br />
You could only put things from a dungeon or things only made up of byproducts from dungeons into the inventory.  </p>
<p>There are 3 conditions for the contract.<br />
Don’t talk about my skill to others.<br />
Taking on being my guard for a year from now on.<br />
Contracting with Haeyeon Guild.<br />
Ahjussi’s guard.<br />
Yeah.<br />
I’m only an F-Rank so I need someone to protect me.<br />
So while I was looking for a suitable person, I saw you.<br />
Hey[8, but still, to get protection from a 15-year-old.<br />
Aren’t you embarrassed.<br />
Even a 10-year-old is stronger than me if their stats rank is higher, so I’m not embarrassed.<br />
Getting all the way here, how would I suddenly be embarrassed.<br />
Simply replying, I took out a pen.<br />
This pen and the ink inside were all made from dungeon byproducts.<br />
I had spread out the contract and was writing down the conditions when Bak Yerim stretched out her neck and peeked at it.  </p>
<p>If you violate the contract, for 1 year all stats 20% drop? The penalty is just this? Even if you break it, it doesn’t seem like a big problem.<br />
20% drop means that the dungeon you can clear is one rank lower.<br />
The difference in the amount of money you make is huge.<br />
But you can still rest for one year.<br />
That’s true.<br />
But this is a Hunter Association certified contract.<br />
If you break a contract, your credit rating will drop to the ground.<br />
Depending on the degree, your Hunter license can be suspended too.<br />
That was why if it wasn’t a backdoor deal, a Hunter Association certified contract was a lot better than an illegal contract with a strong penalty.  </p>
<p>I thought Awakened Person contracts had horrible penalties.<br />
Those exist too.<br />
They’re illegal though.<br />
Only Awakened People have stats so does the effect still work even if we contract now.<br />
It doesn’t matter.<br />
This has a curse skill applied to it and Unawakened people also get skill effects so your physical ability will probably drop 20%.<br />
A curse, you say, that’s scary.<br />
I wrote down all my conditions and signed it.<br />
Bak Yerim, who was watching me, quickly held out her hand for the pen.  </p>
<p>I just have to write down my name, right?When she took the pen and contract and was about to sign her name at once,.<br />
Huh?I quickly took the contract back.<br />
Bak Yerim stared at me as if asking why I did that.<br />
com for a better experience.<br />
Kids are definitely kids.<br />
Huh, why?Sulking, she asked in a sharp voice.<br />
I shook the contract in front of her eyes.  </p>
<p>You should properly check it over before you sign.<br />
But there’s no problem with it.<br />
‘No problem’, she says.  </p>
<p>You left out your conditions.<br />
……Huh, you’re right.<br />
Bak Yerim mumbled blankly.<br />
Right now, the contract one-sidedly contained only my demands.<br />
Maybe because she was embarrassed, her face became a little red.<br />
com for a better experience.<br />
It’s possible to forget sometimes.<br />
Of course, it’s possible to forget.<br />
But being vague and using that kind of excuse doesn’t affect the contract.<br />
That’s what it means to become an Awakened Person, a Hunter.<br />
You can get rights like an adult’s, but you also have to bear responsibility like an adult.<br />
I took back the pen and added conditions related to Bak Yerim’s Awakening and support.  </p>
<p>And, usually these contracts are adjusted.<br />
I already found out you’re going to become an Awakened Person with a high rank.<br />
A prediction of an Awakening rank B or higher.<br />
This is extremely advantageous information for you.<br />
Wherever you go, you’ll get good treatment and if you happen to be A or higher, it’s a free pass to the 3 big guilds.<br />
I spoke, pointing to the ‘contracting with Haeyeon Guild’ condition with the tip of the pen.  </p>
<p>But instead of negotiating the contract conditions, and signing it saying that you’ll go into the guild, isn’t that a stupid thing to do? Being taken by my saying I’ll Awaken you right away and accepting – this condition is too disadvantageous to you.<br />
I drew a line through the ‘contract with Haeyeon Guild’ condition, and revised it to ‘preferentially contract according to conditions – contract conditions are more than Hunter industry average’.  </p>
<p>There.<br />
This should be a fair contract, more or less.<br />
Bak Yerim must have been sulky or surprised; she stared at me with a confused expression.<br />
After a speechless moment, she opened her mouth.<br />
So what do you want me to do.<br />
Was she angry?.<br />
It might have sounded like nagging to you, but what I mean is you’re still at an age where you need an adult’s help.<br />
After you Awaken, there’ll be a lot of people trying to approach you.<br />
Even as a B-Rank, a dungeon lower by 2 levels is D-Rank, and if you clear them 10 times unharmed, you can even go into a B-Rank dungeon.<br />
An orphaned middle schooler with a yearly income of several billions of won.<br />
How easy would it be to take advantage.<br />
Not to mention, Bak Yerim was S-Rank.<br />
If it became known, not to mention within the country, it’d cause a stir in foreign countries as well.  </p>
<p>Among them, they’ll be a lot of guys who’ll approach you acting like a nice person like me, and try to take advantage of you.<br />
Just like how you almost got taken in, you’ll be easily fooled.<br />
……Bak Yerim’s gaze couldn’t meet the contract.<br />
Her expression was still stiff, but rather than being angry, her face looked as if she was lost in thought.  </p>
<p>……But I hate my uncle.<br />
Alright, I know.<br />
I won’t even recommend that kind of person to be your guardian.<br />
It’d be a relief if he doesn’t make off with the money.<br />
He’d 100% run off.<br />
As soon as insulting her uncle came up, the tense atmosphere slightly loosened.  </p>
<p>If you’re okay with it, I want to assume that role for you.<br />
…Isn’t supporting me the same thing.<br />
It’s different.<br />
A simple supporter can’t participate as a Hunter in a deal.<br />
But if they have a guardian, even if the Hunter minor gets into a disadvantageous contract, invalid claims are possible.<br />
Usually, parents often handle it.<br />
For Hunters, just because they were your flesh and blood didn’t mean they could become your guardian.<br />
Only a relevant Hunter could directly appoint them.  </p>
<p>So… I was thinking to take on the role of your parents instead.<br />
I cleared my throat deliberately, pretending to be embarrassed.<br />
And truthfully, it was a little awkward too.<br />
Even before the regression, I wasn’t at an age to have a 15-year-old daughter.  </p>
<p>U-uh… Yeah.<br />
Of course there are various ways I’m ill-suited and insufficient, though.<br />
…Why are you trying to do so much for me? Even if you owed my parents, you said it was just a small bit of help.<br />
Because I also had a difficult time.<br />
It was a lie, and it was also a truth.  </p>
<p>It might simply be vicarious satisfaction.<br />
If only I could’ve had a reliable support back then, something like that.<br />
Though, I probably don’t seem that reliable.<br />
Ahjussi seems like he’ll be reliable enough.<br />
Really.<br />
…Do you have to ask again?It seemed like she didn’t want to pay lip service twice.<br />
I was in the wrong for not being satisfied with once.<br />
Anyways, I understand.<br />
Bak Yerim bashfully rubbed her cheek with her palm.  </p>
<p>Um, please take care of me from now on…?.<br />
Okay, same here.<br />
So……I should have just drunk.<br />
The regret came too late but there was no helping it.<br />
There was no choice but to say it sober.<br />
It also seemed natural to be embarrassed to death.  </p>
<p>I said I would act in place of your parents but of course I’m very lacking.<br />
But as much as your parents loved you, or rather not to that extent, um, how should I say it…Yerim, I love you.<br />
Ack! What is that! So weird!Screeching, Bak Yerim’s face became red and she rubbed her arms as if she had gotten goosebumps.<br />
My face was also definitely red.<br />
Saying nonsense sober was really hard.<br />
But, if the response was that much.<br />
com for the best novel reading experience [Unawakened Person ‘Bak Yerim’ has been influenced by the keyword! As expected, it popped up.<br />
[1 a sizzlingfrying noise, esp with meat [2 lit.<br />
‘fancy as if flower bloomed’ [3 this is a type of cut of beef [4 ok I decided to keep in the 3rd person relationship signifiers (hyung, ahjussi, etc.<br />
) from now on instead of replacing them with.<br />
you”.<br />
Not gonna go back and change everything before retroactively tho.<br />
If someone younger is using.<br />
youtoward someone older in the tl from now on, it’s because no signifiers or pronouns are specified.<br />
[5 one way krns eat meat, particularly grilled meat, is wrapped in lettuce or sesame leaves (or other leafy greens) along with condiments, sometimes rice, veggies, etc.<br />
This is called ssam.<br />
Things don’t come already wrapped – all the ingredients are laid out and each person takes whatever they want and wrap each individually themselves as they eat.<br />
Ssam is also sometimes used to refer to other wrapped foods from different cultures, since the word literally comes from the word.<br />
to wrap”.<br />
[6 raw garlic (as well as cooked) is also an ingredient you can put in ssam.<br />
It’s a bit spicier and tangier but imho it’s really good.<br />

<p>paste for ssam”, which is basically a mix of fermented soybean paste and chili paste [8 a sound that implies playful disbelief or disagreement.<br />
The sound is actually.<br />

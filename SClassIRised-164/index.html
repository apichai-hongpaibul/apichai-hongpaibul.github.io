    <h1 id="the-s-classes-that-i-raised-164">The S-Classes That I Raised-164.</h1>
<p>147 Part 2 I felt full watching Yoohyun and Noah prepare dinner in the kitchen even without eating anything.<br />
They had grown up to be nice people, and Noah had managed to become a decent person under his sister.<br />
They were both commendable.  </p>
<p>Aren’t the kids admirable in every aspect?Yoohyun would still look like Minyui Kim, but they both were younger than me.<br />
I spoke to the men kneeling in a line after turning my head.<br />
They were people related to the Hunter Association, who had acted suspiciously after we ambushed the Dongju Lottery Guild.<br />
There were six in total, out of which four were in high positions in the Association, one was the secretary for the vice president, and the other was a close associate to one of the board members.<br />
I had those whom Noah had captured kneel, but since they were ugly middle-aged men, the sight was not good for the eyes.  </p>
<p>Why can’t you answer? I did not block your mouth.<br />
You think you’ll.  </p>
<p>I will get away with this.<br />
You’re relaxed enough if you’re worried about me.<br />
I was a kidnapper in this situation and felt sad that I had to take away middle-aged men.  </p>
<p>Who would believe you guys if you rambled about being kidnapped and threatened by Yoojin Han after getting relased? I’m a victim of kidnapping who the nation sympathizes with at the moment.<br />
com My image was like that.  </p>
<p>I raised my young brother after my parents died early and left school to do so and spent years apart from him for safety when the dungeons appeared.<br />
I managed to get a nice skill to live my life but then was sent to prison on false charges.<br />
After that, I was kidnapped by those who would sell out their country and stood on auction.<br />
Is there anyone who can beat this story? I’m sure articles are saying that poor Yoojin Han is trying to get over agoraphobia and his trauma about now.<br />
If I were said to be a kidnapper, the response would be that it was another trick to arrest an innocent person.<br />
They would need evidence, but I would not leave anything else behind other than the testamony of those kidnapped.<br />
Who would listen to testaments from the Association when they were already under suspicion?.<br />
You’re deceiving the world by pretending to be weak.<br />
I am weak.<br />
Who would pity me if I were an S class?My ruse was working because people saw me as a weak ordinary individual stuck between superhuman hunters.<br />
Moreover, about ninety percent of that long story was true.<br />
Simyeong Seok looked happy enough to hum as he entered.  </p>
<p>The guests will arrive soon.<br />
Thank you.<br />
com for the best novel reading experience.<br />
Of course.  </p>
<p>You’re Simyeong Seok! I’m friends with your older cousin!One of the kneeling men stood up and shouted, and we both stared at him.  </p>
<p>Do you know him.<br />
Not at all.<br />
He says he’s friends with your cousin.<br />
Our family’s motto is to be strangers in public venues.<br />
How about Hayan.<br />
Kids are exceptions.<br />
Hayan Seok was older than me despite looking young.<br />
The man who had tried to familiarize himself with Simyeong Seok glanced at us and kneeled again.<br />
I did not feel sorry for him being the friend of an acquaintance’s cousin, as we were basically strangers.<br />
com for a better experience I started to place the dishes on the long table as the guests arrived.<br />
I had not thought of how many would come, but we had an even number of six.  </p>
<p>Oh, Director of Dungeon Management Headquarters.<br />
I knew you would stir trouble, but intentionally breaking a dungeon is taking things too far.<br />
The youngest of the guests, Youngjoon Choi, clapped while he addressed one of the men.<br />
The face of the director who had used a profiting dungeon for his greed and then burst it apart turned red.<br />
Was he humiliated or only angry?.<br />
I already heard the story, but an intentional dungeon break is something hard to believe.<br />
There always have been people who sold their country for their own gains.<br />
Ochan Yoo, who had been in charge of the Hunter Market, and Eunyoung Choi, who had been in charge of dungeon management, sat down.<br />
The other three were also those who had worked in the Hunter Association.<br />
They had worked on-site when dungeons first appeared, and chaos ensued, and there had been a lot more than the six people invited here.<br />
While others had taken over most of the high positions, those below remained in the Association and suffered for it.  </p>
<p>Why don’t you guys sit? Even death row convicts are fed.<br />
The six currently involved with the Hunter Association and the six who had been previously affiliated sat in a line across each other.<br />
Their expressions were polar opposites, and things were getting more interesting.  </p>
<p>Mr.<br />
com Eunyoung Choi asked with a suspicious face.  </p>
<p>I would die of overwork if I also had to intervene what the Association does.<br />
You might know that I have too few men, which leads me to act on my own.<br />
I think Haeyeon might have a different opinion.<br />
She stared at Simyeong Seok.  </p>
<p>As I said, they’re cooperating because we need the workforce.<br />
However, they do need to be paid for their efforts, like having a place on this table.  </p>

<p>141 Part 3 I tried to turn off the psychological skill and go out, but Hyunjae Sung stopped me, saying that he believed his memories here would disappear.<br />
I thought it had to do with the Hyunjae Sung outside, not being able to remember himself inside here.  </p>
<p>Green willow leaves!Leaves that other people could not see fluttered, and when some of them gathered around in front of Hyunjae Sung’s eyes, I lifted the rarefaction.<br />
I used the moment he could not see to cut my arm and added poison to the flowing blood.<br />
Poison and fire were at conflict, and the black blood flame was strong enough to burn poison at SS level.<br />
However, if I added poison first and then changed it to fire, it became an effective toxic weapon.<br />
It was a sword made of deadly black blood fire.<br />
I spread my wings and propelled myself to Hyunjae Sung and swung.<br />
The searcher’s chain broke at once, and Hyunjae Sung reached out to the turbulent black sword, and I could see something black in his hand.  </p>
<p>What is that?!The blood fire scattered away, and Hyunjae Sung’s other hand grabbed my collar.<br />
I took a hit in the stomach by his knee, and I coughed and used the silent scream skill.  </p>
<p>That skill is troublesome.<br />
It’s only pain.<br />
You even took a painkiller.<br />
Hyunjae Sung immediately swallowed the most potent painkiller he had after taking the brunt of the doubled silent scream.<br />
While there was a side effect of dulling his senses, he did not seem to have much of a problem.<br />
It did seem to hurt since it was a pain that the painkiller could not entirely nullify.<br />
He offset a skill he could not guard with a painkiller, and I had to hand it to him.<br />
His mind worked fast.  </p>
<p>Isn’t that black thing Mr.<br />
Taewon Song’s skill?I asked Hyunjae Sung after shaking off the arm that was holding my collar and threw a blood flame lance at the same time.<br />
The lance exploded and dispersed in Hyunjae Sung’s hand with a light sound.  </p>
<p>Yes, it’s called pervading loot.<br />
You steal other people’s skills? You are evil.<br />
He stole a looting skill.<br />
Hyunjae Sung’s brow furrowed like he was going through his memories.  </p>
<p>I did not steal it, and I believe he gave it to me as a present.<br />
com for the best novel reading experience.<br />
He gave it to you as a present?! Say something more reasonable.<br />
I’ll bet your head that you stole it.<br />
Then, I’ll bet my item that I received it as a present.<br />
I told you to remove the possessive! Take out an arm so I can confirm.<br />
I spread the day without shadows again.<br />
However, light wrapped around Hyunjae Sung’s feet and scattered the shadows.<br />
Give me a break.  </p>
<p>Nothing works.<br />
I ate the painkiller, and I had to retake it whenever the poison resistance took a certain hit.<br />
I wrapped the black fire with my dragon nails and clawed the ground at his idle talk of filling himself with painkillers.<br />
Half-melted rocks plummeted, and the fire spread on the ground melted the earth as they charged at Hyunjae Sung.<br />
He smiled as the blazing hit and changed the setting.<br />
I used transportation the moment I felt my feet in the water.  </p>
<p>Yes, father.<br />
I almost dropped into the river as my feet slid, hearing his bright voice.<br />
That crazy idiot, we both became bastards.<br />
I did not know whether to complain or laugh, but in a moment, I felt electricity in the water.<br />
A consecutive line of explosions followed through the river.<br />
My barriers shattered in the tornado of heat and magic, and my vision clouded.<br />
A tranquil river in a mountain changed to barren land in an instant.<br />
I brandished flame at the sound of metal flying.<br />
A chain broke through the fire and I made a flame sword and cut it in two, but the chain span and shot at me anyway.<br />
I spread my wings and reflected the chains that ambushed me from behind.<br />
Then I felt a merciless hand grab a wing and rip it apart.  </p>
<p>It’s fortunate I don’t have wings.<br />
Yes, that’s right.<br />
Hey, wait!I wrapped him up in poison since his strength was enough to separate my wing.<br />
The toxic poison spread thickly, and Hyunjae Sung let go of my wing and wrapped an arm around my neck and held me from behind.<br />
I crushed his feet with my heel, but he did not move a muscle because of the painkiller.  </p>
<p>Can I stab you so I can see the memories about your future predictions? I will remember everything after we get out of here, and it would be a win-win situation.<br />
Would you meekly be stabbed.<br />
com for a better experience I had memories that I would not want anyone to see.<br />
Hyunjae Sung placed his chin on my head.<br />
Yes, I admit you’re tall.  </p>
<p>I don’t want to.<br />
It’s for world peace.<br />
That’s too petty.<br />
If you kneel and beg sincerely, I might consider the matter.<br />
My knees ache when it’s cloudy from working all night in the factory.<br />
Why don’t a healthy S class kneel and pretend that I did.<br />
What value does a mere S class have?Hyunjae Sung tapped my shoulder while irritating me.  </p>
<p>You remembered, right.<br />
Yes, I did.<br />
But I don’t know whether I can convey them well.<br />
com for the best novel reading experience I used my teacher’s skills and carved the memories of fighting Hyunjae Sung remembered before the return throughout the battle on my body.<br />
It was for him, who would forget everything when he got out, and for others.  </p>
<p>Do you have anything else? Should we do this one more time.<br />
Please.<br />
How about being stabbed once, maybe three times, or perhaps ten times, and returning my grace?Hyunjae Sung just ignored my request.  </p>

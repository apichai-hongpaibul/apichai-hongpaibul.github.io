<p>Chap 137 Snowfall (1) ‘I should have brought my clothes to the bathroom.<br />
But you never really do that, especially when the bathroom is connected to your bedroom.<br />
I had a large towel, but it would seem strange to hide my chest.<br />
I did that anyway.  </p>
<p>Can you go out so I can change.<br />
Why?My little brother looked me up and down as if to find the wound.<br />
It was a weird request since I washed him and went to public baths together when we were young.  </p>
<p>I feel like it.<br />
You know, an inferiority complex?It was true that my body was less developed than my precocious little brother.<br />
I had nothing to be embarrassed about, but he was too much.  </p>
<p>You don’t look so.<br />
Anyway, turn around, at least.<br />
Irin, you go somewhere too.<br />
com Irin went to Yoohyun, but he did not move a muscle.<br />
I must have raised his suspicions, so I went to the closet using my towel as protection.<br />
I wore my pajama top first, trying not to disturb my wound since his gaze followed me everywhere.<br />
Yerim has gifted them to me, but I had never worn them.<br />
What was with the baby chick embroidery?.<br />
Since everyone couldn’t have used gate stones, did you come alone? What happened to Peace and Yerim? It was an S class dungeon.<br />
I asked, turning around after I finished wearing my pajamas.<br />
I could not help frowning since it meant that Yoohyun had been irresponsible as a Guild leader.  </p>
<p>Yerim Park told me to get out after knowing what was going on, and Peace probably felt the same.<br />
Since the information is reliable and there are experienced guild members with 2 S classes, it would be all right.<br />
Anyway, the dungeon fits Yerim Park’s skillset.<br />
That calmed me down.  </p>
<p>Yerim told you to get out so easily? She would also have tried to come out.<br />
We fixed that peacefully by rock, paper, and scissors.<br />
That was the right decision.<br />
It was nice that they agreed without a fight.<br />
However, Yerim would have been at a physical disadvantage, and her hands might have made it easy for him to know.<br />
It ended smoothly after you left.<br />
I took an old phone out of the drawer.<br />
At least I had this since my data probably could not be recovered.<br />
I should have made back up files of the pictures and videos.  </p>
<p>There were no problems.<br />
Yes.<br />
The dungeon break ended well, too.<br />
Yoohyun seemed not to have contacted Hyunjae Sung or others yet.<br />
I sent a text message to Hyunjae Sung while paying close attention to Yoohyun.<br />
[Please don’t say anything to Yoohyun.<br />
The answer came back quickly.<br />
[^^ What was this? What was he trying to do? A simple emoticon made me want to curse.<br />
com [Please don’t say anything.<br />
Really.<br />
I already had convinced Noah and Taewon Song’s phone must be as dead as mine.<br />
He would not say anything if I managed to convince him later.<br />
Therefore, I just needed to sew Hyunjae Sung’s mouth.<br />
I literally wanted to do so.  </p>
<p>Who are you sending text messages to?Yoohyun approached as I received Hyunjae Sung’s reply.<br />
I managed to hastily press the power button as Yoohyun snatched my phone away.<br />
He spoke in a sour voice.  </p>
<p>There had to have been problems.<br />
I’m fine.<br />
Isn’t that all we need.<br />
You seem pale.<br />
I’m tired.<br />
Yoohyun nodded at me as I said I wanted to go to sleep but turned on my phone anyway.<br />
Hey! How did you know my unlock pattern?.<br />
You unlocked it in front of me a few times.<br />
I remembered it then.<br />
Why do you remember such things? You can’t just see someone else’s phone without their permission! Give it!I tried to take it away from him to no avail.<br />
I just made myself more tired.<br />
As I caught my breath from that little movement, Yoohyun’s eyes narrowed as he seemed to have checked Hyunjae Sung’s messages.<br />
Damn, everything went to hell.<br />
My spine chilled a bit.  </p>
<p>Hey, chick!Please use your teleport skill for your father.<br />
I heard a peeping noise from the living room and saw him slowly fly to me.<br />
However, my little brother caught me before I could escape.<br />
Well, I also did not know if he could teleport me.  </p>
<p>Hey.<br />
Hyunjae Sung just did some outlandish things again.<br />
com for the best novel reading experience.<br />
He was asking if you were all right.<br />
Huh.<br />
You have a fever.<br />
Did I? I was not aware of it.<br />
Yoohyun checked my body temperature and made me sit on the bed.<br />
The chick sat on my lap.<br />
Hey, can you take your father to another place? But if I disappeared from here, more mayhem would ensue.  </p>
<p>Your body is that of a civilian.<br />
If you push It too far, there will be consequences.<br />
Yoohyun spoke, drying my hair.<br />
I was reminded of the past, even though our positions have switched.  </p>
<p>I didn’t do much.<br />
The monsters were at least A class, and you should have escaped instead of jumping in.<br />
Leader Song and Noah should have been more than enough, so you shouldn’t have gone in.<br />
Yeah…that was irrational of me.<br />
com I had not needed to act, but I managed to protect civilians from flying poisonous insects and underground monsters.<br />
If I had not served as bait, at least tens of them would have escaped outside the barricade.<br />
We also would have probably lost the baby wolf.<br />
‘Should I act as bait from now on if a dungeon breaks?I did not want to, but my conscience will suffer if I ignore them.<br />
I could save so many lives… Damn, at least dungeons are being managed well enough, so there is little chance of breaks happening.<br />
If Hayan Seok manages to develop the gate location seeking device, there will be no more undiscovered dungeon breaks.<br />
Ms.<br />
Hayan, please hurry.<br />
I really do not want more attention as I had more than enough now.  </p>
<p>Turn off the poison resistance for your medicine.<br />
Yoohyun took two pills from the inventory.  </p>
<p>What are they.<br />
Fever reducer and painkiller.<br />
I use them for magic overloads, but they are effective for common fevers.<br />
Aren’t they expensive? We have countertop medicine in the kitchen.<br />
They don’t cost much.<br />
Yoohyun thinks that a million dollars for a meal is manageable, so I had little comfort.<br />
Medicine relevant to magic used by S class hunters will go at least by millions.<br />
I used a magic potion instead of water to swallow them.<br />
As they were for hunters, the effects showed immediately, and I felt lighter.<br />
I really had a fever as my condition improved considerably.<br />
Also, I began to fall asleep fast enough that I could not turn the poison resistance skill up again.  </p>
<p>Nice dreams, HyungI fell asleep with Yoohyun’s faint voice in my ears.<br />
You bastard.<br />
<em> * </em> -Peep, peep.<br />
The little bird sitting on Yoojin Han’s chest sang softly.<br />
Yoohyun looked down on his brother’s deep sleep.<br />
One of the pills was a painkiller and fever reducer, but the other was a sleep inducer.<br />
It could be obtained from S class dungeons, and expert hunters would use them for sleep when their senses had become too sensitive after completing a dungeon.<br />
com The pill was known to relax the body and have psychological effects for deep sleep, but Yoohyun had not used it after he had bought the medicine.<br />
While he was allured by an intensive rest, he did not like his body to be out of his control.  </p>
<p>You shouldn’t take them so easily.<br />
Yoohyun gently admonished his brother, but he would have been more bothered if Yoojin had suspected and resisted him.<br />
Yoohyun pressed the call button, and the call was answered shortly.  </p>
<p>What happened?[Why are you asking me this instead of your brother?.<br />
He’s asleep.<br />
[You must have put him to sleep.<br />
Yoohyun did not comment on Hyunjae Sung’s piercing words.  </p>
<p>com [I wonder how you were in that place.<br />
A question answered his question, and Yoohyun responded indifferently.  </p>
<p>I’m asking because I was not there.<br />
[Can you send an S class scallion from your kitchen? I want to see one.<br />
What are you talking about?[If you really weren’t there, there must have been an S class scallion.<br />
Yoohyun’s brow furrowed in Hyunjae Sung’s strange words.  </p>
<p>Tell me about Taewon Song since I need to decide what to do in the future.<br />
[You don’t have to worry about chief Song.<br />
com for the best novel reading experience Hyunjae Sung continued leisurely.<br />
[He could not protect Yoojin against me.<br />
That would firmly fix Yoojin Han’s place for Taewon Song.<br />
He would have been disturbed to see a sheep playing with a wolf and wonder if the sheep was a wolf in sheep’s clothing.<br />
However, a sheep is a sheep even if he was taken in by a wolf giving a sheepdog‘s protection.<br />
[Of course, since a wolf is a wolf even if he’s pretending to be a sheepdog, a sheep could get hurt during protection.<br />
Maybe I should send leader Song a comforting message.<br />
Yoohyun opened his mouth as he let Hyunjae Sung’s low laugh pass.  </p>
<p>What did my brother ask you to not say to me?[So, he did keep it a secret from you.<br />
Yoohyun breathed softly to control his anger as he heard Hyunjae Sung’s pitying voice.<br />
He knew something that Yoohyun did not.<br />
That bothered him to no end, and the back of his neck stiffened.<br />
However, even if it was possible, Yoohyun could not remove Hyunjae Sung.<br />
That bastard held some meaning to Yoojin, and if he disappeared, his brother would push himself even further than he had been up to now.<br />
com Since Hyunjae Sung was efficient and useful, Yoohyun had to tolerate him if he was cooperated with Yoojin.  </p>
<p>Please tell me.<br />
There was a coherent reply this time to Yoohyun’s subdued voice.<br />
[His chest wound.  </p>
<p>A wound?[It was a scar that a B class healing skill was useless on.<br />
If it were a flesh wound, healing skills lower than a B class would remove it cleanly.<br />
So, it was not an ordinary wound.<br />
Yoohyun unconsciously clenched his teeth as he reached out to Yoojin.<br />
com The little bird pecked at his hand as if to let his nurturer sleep.<br />
The chick rolled and moved right next to Yoojin’s face and peeped as if to complain.<br />
-Peep! Peep!.<br />
Be quiet.<br />
Yoojin would not wake easily, but if that chick incessantly peeped, who knows what would happen.<br />
Yoohyun tapped the little beak and unbuttoned his brother’s pajama top.<br />
There was a wound, as Hyunjae Sung had said.<br />
It was a cut near the heart, a recent one he had not seen.<br />
Yoojin frowned and picked up a high-class potion to try, but even that could not remove the little scar.  </p>
<p>What is this?[Yoojin Han seems to have found something fun again, but he’s keeping it a secret for now.<br />
I only know that it has something to do with a magic stone.<br />
If you concentrate, you can feel a faint aura of the magic stone from the wound.<br />
Yoohyun placed his fingertips on the wound and concentrated as Hyunjae Sung had said.<br />
There was faint, strange magic.<br />
He remembered that the monsters would only rush at Yoojin.<br />
Monsters are more aware of magic stones compared to humans.<br />
The magic stone detector was made using a monster’s skill.<br />
com ‘a prey with an F class body, but with a high-class magic stone…If Yoohyun could feel a faint aura, the magic stone was not a low to middle class magic stone.<br />
Even an S class hunter who is sensitive to magic had difficulties knowing the magic stone in a monster.<br />
Even an S class stone could not be felt if it was deeply embedded.<br />
So, if the aura was anything to go by, the magic stone was at least an S class, maybe stronger….<br />
What are you trying to do, Hyung?Yoohyun ended the call uneasily, and the phone fell on the bed with a thud.<br />
<em> * </em> My view was filled with white snowflakes falling when I opened my eyes.<br />
It was then that I knew this was a dream, as snow fell incessantly, and white branches reached out endlessly.<br />
A tree from which snow fell.<br />
‘I knew I would see this sooner or later.<br />
com Maybe because of my fear resistance skill, I had seldom dreamed of my little brother before my return.<br />
However, my fear resistance level was lowered and dreams attacked you viciously as soon as you lower your guard.<br />
I will probably get no sleep for a while.<br />
They had said that the skill would last for about four days, and since it was going to be twice as effective, it might last longer.<br />
I had so much to do and now everything was going haywire.<br />
Taewon Song, it is too much.<br />
Can you cancel the skill? ‘At least this place isn’t too bad.<br />
’ Since it was a dream, the place would be different from reality, but I looked around to confirm in advance.<br />
While I could not move my body, I could shift the view.<br />
The snowfields were wide and barrenly empty.<br />
I seemed to be standing in the middle of a snowy field in the middle of nowhere.<br />
I saw something then.<br />
A body that seemed too small was between the thick roots of the tree.<br />
I take my words back.<br />
It was a nightmare.<br />
But I could not take my eyes off it, as I would in a common nightmare.  </p>

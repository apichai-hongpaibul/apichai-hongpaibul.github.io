<p>&lt; Q&amp;A (2) .<br />
Water Droplet: I apologize.<br />
Those guys don’t seem like it but their abilities are good.<br />
Tree: It’s water that’s past staying still for a while, to starting to rot.<br />
Water change doesn’t happen at all here, you know~.<br />
[1 Water Droplet: The second reason is, it is a beginner-use auxiliary system to a certain point.<br />
Honey: Beginner-use? Water Droplet: Yes.<br />
The people in Honey’s world are like that.<br />
Take for instance, an ability to fly appearing one day.<br />
How would you realize that? Would there be anybody who would be like ‘ah, I should try flying!’? That was so.<br />
Who knew if you were a young kid, but if normal adults attempted to fly by themselves, they would be sent to a psychiatric hospital.<br />
Water Droplet: That is why the thing applied that seemed the most suitable for Honey’s world is exactly those status windows.<br />
A game-like system with rectangular windows that show levels, abilities, skill, and even rewards.<br />
Tree: But since it’s beginner-use to a certain extent, it’s not far until it disappears.<br />
Water Droplet: The adjustment level will be examined and in roughly 10 years, give or take, it will gradually go away.<br />
Sequentially, starting from the windows of the people who have already Awakened.<br />
com Honey: Do you have to take them away? If the status windows disappear, afterwards, it will be difficult for Awakened People to realize they have Awakened.<br />
It was convenient in various ways having a system.<br />
Water Droplet: Please do not worry about that.<br />
They have not adjusted enough right now, so people cannot feel their own abilities.<br />
And even if they felt it, they would be confused about if it was real or just a delusion.<br />
Tree: Even now, if you’re about S-Rank, you can slightly sense others’ abilities.<br />
Once the system disappears, that sensation will become stronger.<br />
Among them, sensitive people will probably be able to sense even Unawakened People’s abilities.<br />
That’s why Honey’s Seed-Leaf skill rank is on the lower side, compared to the current usefulness.<br />
At any rate, I had been wondering if it wasn’t too good to be an S-Rank.<br />
When the ability to check expected Awakening status windows became common, it would only leave the optimized Awakening effect once per month, so it was exactly S-Rank level.<br />
Tree: Also, the beginner system may be a comfortable guide, but it’s a restriction that draws limits too.<br />
Water Droplet: It is similar to only being able to move within the system in a game, unlike reality.<br />
I suppose it feels convenient right now that ranks and skills appear clearly.<br />
But if it is determined like that, it becomes harder to escape.<br />
Tree: F-Rank Awakened People can never become S-Ranks.<br />
Since, in the view of the system, the amount of growth for an F-Rank is determined.<br />
No matter how much you try, B-Rank is the limit.<br />
On top of that, initially, the system has a safeguard too, so it’s hard to grow at all as a skill-stat both F, outside of exceptional cases.<br />
Water Droplet: Since people keep on changing.<br />
There is nothing determined.<br />
Of course stats, but skills too.<br />
com Tree: And, we and the system aren’t accurate either.<br />
Especially lately, our accuracy has fallen a little because of Honey.<br />
…Because of me? Newcomer: That is true! Can’t you please decrease the frequency of use for the Seed-Leaf-skill? Just even 20% is fine.<br />
I think I will die from overwork!(ㅠ◇ㅠ) Tree: Each time you use the Seed-Leaf skill on a new person, we have to examine them and put in the expected rank and skills.<br />
Our side’s time is regulated appropriately, but still it’s a little hard.<br />
The time we can use in a day isn’t infinite.<br />
Honey: …I apologize.<br />
I didn’t know they were actually doing it manually in real time.<br />
Honey: I will decrease it to about half.<br />
Water Droplet: Please do.<br />
If the accuracy falls too much, it would be difficult for Honey too.<br />
That was obvious.<br />
I couldn’t wrestle with a wrong skill.<br />
com Honey: Can’t you possibly add the skill names intuitively? Water Droplet: It is possible for new skills, but it is hard for skills whose information has already been saved.<br />
We can only touch a few of them.<br />
And, it is incredibly rare for skills to have never shown up before.<br />
Tree: Truthfully, there’s hardly any.<br />
Hardly any, they said.<br />
New skills being rare when the number of current Awakened People wasn’t that much, meant that there were other worlds, as expected.<br />
Like the place where the Gold Forge’s past owner lived.<br />
Honey: Speaking of, it seems like solely the explanation for the Gold Forge’s Owner skill is detailed.<br />
On top of that, you gave items too.<br />
Tree: Ohh, that was the previous skill holder using his power.<br />
A cost was needed, and he sacrificed himself.<br />
For the future of others.<br />
Water Droplet: He was a good ahjussi.<br />
As all the outstanding blacksmiths were, he was good at cooking too.<br />
Tree: I miss him.<br />
Good people really do leave quickly.<br />
com The thing called cost seemed to be a type where you had to give your life, no matter how I looked at it.<br />
Seeing how it was sent as an item, it should have been thanks to a characteristic of the skill, too.<br />
Tree: We can’t explain in detail, but it’s a really rare case.<br />
It’s impossible with a mediocre ability.<br />
Water Droplet: And it was 1-time only so the next skill holder would be normal.<br />
Myeongwoo lucked out[2.<br />
Water Droplet: For us too, something like detailedly writing down skill explanations is possible, but like I said earlier, this is the first time the Perfect Caregiver title came out.<br />
There is no information.<br />
Tree: Just the Caregiver is also an incredibly rare title compared to rank.<br />
Newcomer: That is true, this was my first time seeing the Caregiver title too! Caregiver was? That was a surpise.<br />
com S-Ranks were rare, but it wasn’t a small number, and there were a lot of cases where the parents had survived.<br />
So I had thought that there were a few other people with the Caregiver title who were just not revealing it like me.<br />
Tree: It’s a little different.<br />
To explain, we have to tell you about high rank Awakened People.<br />
It’s okay right? Water Droplet: Yeah.<br />
Since it would be good for Honey to know the information too.<br />
Tree: You can only receive the Caregiver title if you are regarded as a caregiver by a born S-Rank Awakened Person instead of an ordinary S-Rank Awakened Person.<br />
Honey: Born? Tree: If you use the Seed-Leaf skill, the expected Awakened stat rank comes up, right? That’s S.<br />
Not A or A~S.<br />
Among the Awakened People right now, there’s exactly five… there are three who met Honey? The two I had checked were Yoohyun and Riette.<br />
The remaining one was probably Sung Hyunjae.<br />
Then did that mean that all the other S-Ranks I had met thus far were all expected stat rank A~S? Water Droplet: Truthfully, the abilities people are born with are not equal, right? Even in Honey’s world, before Awakened People appeared, there were a lot people who alone stood out.<br />
Expected stat rank S are kind of irregular even among those amazingly endowed people.<br />
In the view of the system, rank S is the relevant world’s main species’ threshold.<br />
For skills, there are a lot of abilities that go past the body, so SS-Rank and higher can come out, but it is not so for stats.<br />
It is not impossible to break past the limit through effort, but of course it is difficult, and it takes a long time.<br />
At the least, in units of ten years.<br />
The highest for stats was definitely S-Rank.<br />
So, even 5 years later, there weren’t any SS-Rank Hunters.<br />
com Water Droplet: And expected Awakening stat ranks are, to a certain extent, the ranks of a novice who has just Awakened and has the possibility of growth left.<br />
Even looking at just the Seed-Leaf skill, it is optimized Awakening, not maximum amount or threshold Awakening, right? So being at the level of being between A and S is that species’ maximum Awakening stat rank.<br />
Tree: In other words, born S-Ranks are outside of the standard.<br />
Honey’s is on the side of having a large population, so there are already five, but usually it’s just two to three per generation.<br />
This minority outside of the standard, how should I say it, can’t mix well with their own kind.<br />
Water Droplet: A~S-Ranks also tend to look down on people with low abilities.<br />
But in extreme cases, S-Ranks could get to the level of not even treating them as the same kind.<br />
At the same time, their own kind, especially normal people, instinctively regard the S-Ranks as unpleasant.<br />
Somehow they feel cowed and it is a little uncomfortable to talk with them – it is about that level, but that small difference is quiet large.<br />
Tree: It’s hard to properly play the role of parent if you’re cowed by a young kid.<br />
As I read the words on the window, I remembered when I was young.<br />
Yoohyun was cute.<br />
I didn’t think I had ever felt him unpleasant.<br />
Tree: So the Caregiver title doesn’t come out much.<br />
And, that title holders’ lifespans are usually short.<br />
Honey: Sorry? Water Droplet: It is just that the probability of being killed is high.<br />
They are cases where people could not touch the S-Rank, so instead the family was targeted.<br />
Disposition-wise, there are a lot of tyrant types.<br />
It is a relief that Honey’s world is stable in that regard.<br />
Tyrants, they said.<br />
It didn’t seem like there was much of a difference from the other guild leaders.<br />
Not just Yoohyun, but I couldn’t feel any weird points from the other two.<br />
com Honey: You said that I met three born S-Ranks, but I did not really feel that they were different.<br />
I do have Fear Resistance, but their attitudes themselves all seem fine.<br />
I didn’t need to say anything about Yoohyun, and Riette was also past being friendly to excessively clinging.<br />
Though it seemed like it was largely due to the Dragon Slayer title for Riette, even Sung Hyunjae, who didn’t have anything like that, was nice.<br />
Tree: That’s because it’s Honey.<br />
Water Droplet: Your stats are low so you are not threatening, but your special skills are high.<br />
Combat-aptitude high rank Awakened People like that kind of thing.<br />
If you are S-Rank, you can directly feel that, so they like it even more.<br />
Besides Honey, there is one other person like that.<br />
Yoo Myeongwoo? Or were they talking about the saint-nim? Then again, the saint-nim was popular among the high rank Hunters.<br />
She was something like the doyenne of the Hunter community.<br />
Tree: Just imagining it, it’s really cute.<br />
I also □□□□□□□□□□□□ those past guys.<br />
Ah, oops.<br />
Sorry.<br />
Water Droplet: Newcomer, thanks for the quick handling.<br />
Newcomer: You are welcome! Were those □ for blocking excessive information? Though it was a different atmosphere from Deer and Wolf.<br />
com Tree: Our stories are useless information, though.<br />
I just thought of past things.<br />
Water Droplet: There’s not much left now, so be careful.<br />
Still, Honey, please be careful of high rank Awakened People.<br />
They may fundamentally have goodwill toward Honey, but the difference in strength is so large that the goodwill could become violence.<br />
Generally, there are a lot of selfish and self-centered aspects, so it is even more dangerous.<br />
We want Honey to safely gather S-Ranks.<br />
Tree: That’s right.<br />
Safety is the best.<br />
It’s okay if it takes a bit of a long time.<br />
About 5 years? Originally, there was enough room for about 10 years, but as you know, 5 years disappeared.<br />
Water Droplet: Anyways, it would have been hard to find a different method within the time, so even if it decreased 5 years, please do not mind.<br />
Honey: Yes.<br />
If it was 5 years, then it was sufficiently enough time.<br />
When Peace grew soon, it would be three, and one more baby monster was planned to arrive.<br />
And I thought I would bring over from Seseong, too.<br />
And if I put in Riette and her brother and the Breaker Guild Leader, it was already eight, and if Kim Sunghan also safely grew, then it would be nine.<br />
Even if I was relaxed about it, wouldn’t I gather all of them in two to three years? Honey: Are monsters also included in the 50? Just in case, I asked them.<br />
If it was limited to humans, it could get a little harder.<br />
com for a better experience Water Droplet: As long as the keyword is applied, there is no problem.<br />
Then it was easy.<br />
I was relieved of a big worry for now.<br />
Tree: Is there anything you’re curious of outside of that? Hm, what was there? I more or less knew the reason why they showed interest in me, which bothered me the most.<br />
I didn’t hear in detail, but they said I only had to fill up with 50 S-Ranks.<br />
And I got enough information about the system.<br />
About skills, Awakened People… ah, dungeons.<br />
Honey: Are the dungeon formation laws the same as they were originally? I am doing the related investigations.<br />
Newcomer: They are the same! Only the speed became faster.<br />
Sometimes 5-years-later dungeons come out, but we are working to handle them immediately! Then I only needed to make up for the speed.<br />
com Tree: The relevancy is too big, so it’s dangerous.<br />
Some day, you’ll be able to know, even if you don’t want to.<br />
Water Droplet: That is right.<br />
Honey will be able to know it all in the end.<br />
In due time.<br />
……I mean, it didn’t matter even if I didn’t know.<br />
The meaningful words were completely making me uneasy.<br />
Besides this, there really wasn’t anything else, right? Even if I asked about those people, it probably wouldn’t be allowed.<br />
They had already been blocked with □.<br />
It seemed like I had found out more or less everything I needed to know.<br />
Honey: I have one last thing.<br />
Could I possibly tell my younger sibling about the system? That guy is completely uneasy and I would like having one person to reveal it to.<br />
We happened to have come into the dungeon together, and it would be even better if you would sent a message window to my sibling.<br />
If he got a message from the system, he would probably easily believe me.<br />
Tree: To your sibling? Wait, wait.<br />
It’s dangerous for the information to spread, so not a lot…… if it’s at the level of saying you’re helping us, then it’s okay.<br />
When you send a signal, we’ll send the promised message.<br />
Simply something like ‘sstm’? Honey: Yes, please take care of it.<br />
It would be good if I could pacify that Yoohyun with this.<br />
com Newcomer: As expected, you think a lot about your younger sibling! Brothers and sisters[3 who get along well, are really great˘▽˘ No, he was a younger brother, though.<br />
Deer: My love!! Don’t just take care of your sibling and call me unni!♡ε♡ Wolf: I’m oppa!! Newcomer: The two of you really have no conscience.<br />
Oppa is correct for me! ……What were these people saying.<br />
Honey: I am a man.<br />
The chat window was silent for a moment.<br />
Then.<br />
com Excuse me, it seems like your character changed a little.<br />
Water Droplet: The weight on my chest I had for a thousand years is all disappearing![4 If they had a weight for a thousand years, then it was enough for them to change.<br />
Newcomer: Will you really cut it? Water Droplet: If you staked it, then it has to be cut! What did Wolf stake? Why is it quiet? Did both of them run away? Ah, I apologize, Honey.<br />
Of course you are a man.<br />
I thought you were so.<br />
I apologize for the bet as well.<br />
Those guys kept on insisting so I lost my temper.<br />
Honey: It is alright.<br />
Tree: If you don’t have any other questions, should we send you back? For us, it would be fine if you hung out for longer.<br />
Honey: Yes.<br />
com What do you mean, probably? Several days couldn’t have passed or something, right? If it did, then there would be a huge commotion.<br />
Even now, it was a little uneasy.<br />
Newcomer: It has not been long! I am not sure, but it would be about 30 minutes at best?Advertisements …More time had passed than I had thought.<br />
Honey: Is it possible to shorten the time, or something? Newcomer: It is a state where we are connected, so it is difficult.<br />
Should we send you right away? Honey: Yes.<br />
Still, if it was about 30 minutes, then it should be okay.<br />
Now, I could explain about the system too.<br />
The lights that were forming the chat window and the keyboard dispersed again, and the surrounding darkness turned blurry.<br />
Then, the scenery in front of my eyes changed back.<br />
To a large field.<br />
com There was definitely a thick forest between the seashore, but it had all disappeared.<br />
I could clearly see the sea.<br />
‘Did… all of it burn?’ The ashes scattering around on the wind was ominous.<br />
-Keuhang! Just then, I suddenly heard the cry of a ferocious beast.<br />
When I reflectively turned around, a magic beast that was bigger than a lion, with red and gold fur mixed together, dashed to me.<br />
I unconsciously stepped back and used the Seed-Leaf Skill.<br />
com for a better experience Flame Breath(S) Achieve after growth Blaze Run(A) Achieve after growth Giant Fire(A) Achieve after growth Flame Resistance(A) Acquired ※No growth without an adult’s help ……It was Peace? [1 what this whole part is referring to metaphorically is when an organization doesn’t change up its members so it declines, sort of like the eng ‘bringing in freshnew blood’.<br />
Esp ‘water change’ is used metaphorically to refer to changing the membersexecs of an institution on a relatively large scale.<br />
I didn’t know how to put that in eng without completely changing it in order to make sense, so I’m putting the explanation in the footnote.<br />
[2 back in the olden(?) times, ppl would form a 계, which is a group where the members chip in a certain amt of money and then they takes turns with one person taking the gathered money each time they meet up.<br />
It being your turn is called 계 타다 and that’s the expression used here.<br />
It’s used metaphorically to mean you (suddenly) got a lot of money, or depending on context, that you got lucky, since if it’s your turn to take the money, it’s a lucky thing.<br />
[3 this is a word for ‘siblings’ but specifically ‘brother and sister from the same family’, which is why yj is surprised in the next sent, bc it’s implying one of them is a woman.  </p>

<p>&lt; Blacksmith’s Debut (1) .  </p>
<p>Ahjussi, ahjussi, ahjussi!!As soon as I turned in the hallway, I met Yerim, who had just come out of the elevator.<br />
I had heard that she was going to a B-Rank dungeon attack, but it seemed like she had already finished.<br />
She must’ve washed at the maintenance room and came up, because she was wearing a short sleeves and shorts tracksuit and her hair was damp.  </p>
<p>So that’s the new monster you brought over.<br />
Yeah, this is the Gold Gryphon, Blue.<br />
Cute! Can I trying hugging it?Peace hated it, but wouldn’t Blue be okay? And she was already sending a gaze filled with curiosity toward Yerim.<br />
-Kkyaa! When I held her out from where I was holding her in my arms, she flapped over to Yerim on her own.<br />
Yerim spread her arms open wide and pulled Blue over into a hug.  </p>
<p>com Since it was right after eating through a huge container.<br />
-Kkyaoo kkya!.<br />
Peace had golden beans[1 but this one has pink beans? Look at the bottoms of the paws, I want to bite them! Blue~.<br />
Maybe she had understood she was getting affection, because Blue’s tail whirled like a fan.<br />
She was an eagle plus lion, but this guy was like a puppy who liked socializing.  </p>
<p>Truthfully, ahjussi’s naming sense is like an ahjussi’s.<br />
……What.<br />
Putting aside Peace, what’s Chirpie and Blue? I head the unicorns were White and Black.<br />
They aren’t countryside dogs, so to think that it’s Whitey and Blackie[2 – it’s completely like an ahjussi.<br />
I-it’s intuitive, and they’re short and good, aren’t they?They were easy to understand and convenient things were the best… was thinking that way like an ahjussi? I mean, even considering before the regression, I was only thirty.<br />
com for a better experience.<br />
But where are you going? To the training room.<br />
To meet Hunter Association people.<br />
Ah, then I’ll go with you! These days you only go with Guild Leader! The one who’s supposed to protect ahjussi is me.<br />
You were busy going into dungeons.<br />
And from now on, she would get even busier.<br />
Since she had to make her own S-Rank team.<br />
As expected, I should help out a bit.<br />
I entrusted Blue to the Hunter on duty today, and then went down.<br />
When I met Yoohyun, I thought that this guy wasn’t doing any work at all compared to Yerim.<br />
At this guy’s level, going with me was like going on an outing, not going to an attack.  </p>
<p>Haven’t you not gone into a dungeon at all lately? You don’t have to manage S-Rank dungeons?If it was a low grade S-Rank dungeon that you had perfect attack information for, it was possible to attack with just an A-Rank team, but besides that, an S-Rank Hunter was necessary.<br />
The number of S-Rank dungeons that Haeyeon was managing was probably still small, but it wasn’t to the extent of being able to play around.  </p>
<p>I do have to go within ten days.<br />
com Yoohyun said, looking at me with worried eyes.  </p>
<p>Once I start attacking an S-Rank dungeon, I have to be gone for at least a week, so I was putting it off as much as possible.<br />
Me being… distant from hyung was also largely due to the S-Rank dungeon attack time.<br />
Since, once I go into a dungeon, I obviously can’t pay attention.<br />
The length of an S-Rank dungeon attack was at minimum a week, in cases where there was attack information.<br />
If it was a first attack, it could get to over one month.<br />
If the characteristics match was bad, it could take fifteen days even if there was enough information.<br />
Having to leave for that long of a time periodically was one of the biggest weak points of a guild that had an S-Rank Hunter as a guild leader.<br />
Since, not only the guild leader, but even the elite high rank Hunters had to leave their places empty.<br />
On top of that, contact wasn’t possible, and you couldn’t come out in the middle.<br />
Though later, if it was a giant guild, they had two or more S-Rank Hunters by default, so that weak point disappeared.  </p>
<p>Now there is me, so why don’t you quickly go, Yoohyun oppa.<br />
Yerim said, clinging onto my arm.  </p>
<p>I will take good care of ahjussi.<br />
All this time, I have diligently gone into dungeons, so I can take a vacation for around ten days and stick close to him.<br />
While we are at it, do you want to look my skills, and do you want to go into a dungeon together? Or how about a escape room cafe? I have always wanted to go, but I couldn’t because it was expensive.<br />
An escape room cafe.<br />
I haven’t been to one either.  </p>
<p>…What is that?……Gosh, was that something a twenty-year-old should say? I felt like I could cry for him.<br />
Wasn’t it the height of when he should be playing around, well-informed about the trends?.<br />
You come too.<br />
Ah, I was going to go with just ahjussi.<br />
That guy said he hasn’t ever been either.<br />
……Okay.<br />
Since we’re not going to go just once.<br />
Then, since we’re going out anyways, should we go today.<br />
If there’s nothing big, then let’s do that.<br />
I nodded my head lightly and got into the car.<br />
The place we arrived at after driving fast for a long time, wasn’t the Hunter Association, but the Awakening Center that still wasn’t open yet.<br />
Unlike the Association building, it was located in the outskirts of Seoul and would carry out the function of the Association in an emergency.<br />
com That building next to the round dome-shaped Awakening Center was the same as Hunter Association No.<br />
2.<br />
Specifically, the Awakening Center was stuck in belatedly.<br />
It was still thought of as just a new Hunter Association building by the public.  </p>
<p>I will go look for a cafe with good reviews!Yerim said, waving her arm to send us off.<br />
When I looked at the new smooth exposed building, I felt a little unsettled inside.<br />
It was place I didn’t have good memories of.<br />
It was the opposite.<br />
The steps that hadn’t been stepped on much, were glossy.<br />
There was nothing in the surroundings.<br />
Not the fluttering banners, nor the gathered journalists.<br />
It was quiet.  </p>
<p>What are you doing not going in?When I stopped and stood, Yoohyun turned to look at me suspiciously.  </p>
<p>I was just looking around.<br />
I replied like it was nothing and walked on.<br />
It was place I didn’t want to come to again, but it didn’t feel that bad.<br />
It could’ve been thanks to it being disappeared matters, and it could’ve been because of the Fear Resistance.<br />
Anyways, I told you to be nice to Myeongwoo, but why did you go and pick a fight?I asked, going up the stairs.<br />
What were you going to do if he didn’t make you a weapon because of that?.<br />
It wasn’t a fight; I was checking what he thought of hyung.<br />
Since there’s something hyung deceived him about.<br />
Just in case, if he seemed like he would resent hyung for that, I can’t just let it go.<br />
You replied well when I told you not to bother him.<br />
It’s dangerous because the skill is so good.<br />
Myeongwoo isn’t a guy who would do something like that, and I’m going to confess it to him first.<br />
If you happen to fall out, definitely tell me.<br />
Don’t hide it.<br />
……Ok.<br />
Though I thought that he wouldn’t be hostile even if it was possible for us to become distant.<br />
Still, in the unlikely case we fell out, like Yoohyun said, he was a dangerous opponent.<br />
com for a better experience It would probably be okay… but should I have been better to him? We opened the door and went inside.<br />
Inside the building was also completely empty.<br />
The long desk still had plastic covering it.<br />
I wondered if they needed to call us over to here if it was like this.<br />
Why didn’t they just call us over to the close-by main Association building? Except for the guide standing in front of the entrance to the hallway a bit away, there wasn’t anybody.<br />
We joined him and went along the hallway.  </p>
<p>This is the center of the Awakening Center, the Awakening Room.<br />
When we passed the long hallway, the guide spoke, stopping at the round lobby.<br />
Besides the entrance we came through, there were five doors in all directions.<br />
At that time, it looked cramped, but it was quite wide, seeing it now when it was completely empty.<br />
Inside the Awakening Room was still incomplete.<br />
We went around, looking around, and then went toward the place where the Hunter Association Head and other high up people were waiting.  </p>
<p>The A-Rank, B-Rank Hunters whom Hunter Han Yoojin has sent, have safely Awakened.<br />
The vice-head, who looked a little younger than the Association Head, said.<br />
Two Hunters’ profile data was placed in front of me.<br />
While I was looking for special skill holders, I sent the A-Rank, B-Rank combat aptitude Unawakened People I found additionally, to the Association.<br />
It was to prove my skill and get the Awakening Center related cooperation.<br />
Looking at the data, the A-Rank had gotten two of the three optimized skills, and the B-Rank had gotten all three.<br />
As expected, it was relatively easy for combat aptitudes to optimally Awaken.<br />
com for the best novel reading experience.<br />
As you can see, five of the six skills you have told us of ahead of time, also safely appeared.<br />
As you have advised, we created situations that fit the abilities they were expected to have according to their skill names.<br />
One of Hunter Kang Donghoon’s B-Rank skills is regretful, but Hunter Han Yoojin’s Unawakened People status window checking skill’s ability was certainly authentic.<br />
Then, I suppose I can expect an affirmative answer.<br />
Since I tossed you high rank Hunters, pay the price.  </p>
<p>If Hunter Han Yoojin safely Awakens special skills as well, even if we try not to, we can’t help but cooperate, right?This time, the Association Head spoke.  </p>
<p>No, it’s even welcome for a system to be made so that visitation to the Awakening Center can only be possible after receiving status window verification from Hunter Han Yoojin.<br />
What do you think of making something like an Unawakened Person aptitude checking center.<br />
…I think that is a little excessive.<br />
Were you thinking of working me to the bone?.<br />
First of all, my ability cannot handle a large number.<br />
The skill rank is high, but my stat rank is low.<br />
In that situation, if you place a restriction saying that people have to receive my confirmation first, I will get the most criticis… that couldn’t possibly be your goal.<br />
Hahaha, would that be so?The Association Head waved his hands, but I didn’t trust him at all.<br />
I needed to have choices and it needed to be a private establishment, for me to receive less criticism even if I took in only one to two hundred per day.  </p>
<p>It’s because people who will hastily Awaken wrong are a waste.<br />
It is one’s own choice, so there is no choice but for it to be this way.<br />
It is not possible to take care of all people one by one.<br />
If it was this much, I did as much as I could.<br />
Besides trying to uselessly push more work onto me, the Association was cooperative.<br />
At the escape room cafe, I felt like I said to not break it about a hundred times.<br />
Was seeing Yerim and Blue superimposed a mistake of my eyes? Still, Yerim at least understood my words.  </p>
<p>Ahjussi, let’s come back together again! The two of us!Don’t make me laugh.<br />
We returned to Haeyeon, and I went to the unicorns in the training room before going up to the dorm floor.<br />
Yerim said she wanted to see, so she trailed after me.<br />
Whitey, Blackie[3, hi~.<br />
Which one is the girl.<br />
The black one.<br />
So this one, how pretty.<br />
Come here.<br />
Yerim, towards Blackie, no it was Black[4.<br />
Anyways, she held her hand out toward the black baby unicorn.<br />
The unicorn raised her ears up straight, and then bit the held out hand.  </p>
<p>Ahaha, that tickles Blackie~.<br />
You have to tell her not to bite.<br />
Or else it’ll become a habit.<br />
It might tickle for you, but an Unawakened Person’s fingers will get cut off.<br />
Oh.<br />
No! Blackie!-Puheung! At Yerim’s light tap against her head, Blackie was startled and drew back.<br />
She searched the surroundings and then scuttled behind me, hiding.<br />
The white guy followed too.<br />
com for the best novel reading experience.<br />
Kids! Where are you hiding? That ahjussi is weaker than my little finger!Little finger was too much.<br />
Though it was true I was weak.<br />
After taking care of the unicorns’ food, I also took care of Blue.<br />
The Hunter I left that guy with said, ‘It seems you have many hardships,’ with eyes filled with sympathy.<br />
At that, it was a relief that there were no worries about money; if I had a poor household, I would have cried.  </p>
<p>Peace, Chirpie.<br />
How were you?-Kkiang! -Chirp! When Peace barked with a solemn posture, Blue flapped out of my arms.<br />
Our Blue, so it wasn’t like there wasn’t any learning effect.<br />
I went to give Yerim the side dishes she asked for, took care of the kids, and even ate dinner, but for some reason, Myeongwoo didn’t appear.<br />
Even when Blue and Chirpie were sleeping and Peace was starting to nod off, I still didn’t hear any news.<br />
‘And I can’t contact him either.<br />
com for the best novel reading experience Maybe because it was a subspace, even cell phones didn’t have service in the Gold Forge, like when going into a dungeon.<br />
Unless Myeongwoo came out first, there was no way to contact him.<br />
He was actually in the Forge, right? There were times when he did stay up during the night, but he came out every meal time to eat.<br />
Didn’t you have to eat properly if you were doing work that required strength? Why wasn’t he coming out? I slept fitfully from worry, and then it was morning.<br />
Just when I took out Blue, who cried right on time like a rooster, and was wondering if I had to find a way to contact the subspace, finally Myeongwoo appeared.  </p>
<p>Hey! If you’re going to stay in the Forge for this long, then you should at least say something! I was worrying that something happened inside of there.<br />
Sorry.<br />
The mouth was saying sorry, but the face was widely smiling.<br />
Maybe because he had stayed up the night, it was dark underneath his eyes, but the expression at least was bright.<br />
Enough to be able to see right away that something good had happened.  </p>
<p>I couldn’t stop myself in the middle.<br />
Saying that, Myeongwoo took something out from his inventory.<br />
It was a long spear that seemed about 2 meters in length.<br />
With a bluish chill lingering from the blade to the handle, it wasn’t a normal object.  </p>
<p>Is that possibly.<br />
com for the best novel reading experience.<br />
Here.<br />
When I took the spear that was held out, a simple item explanation window popped up, [Parmini’s Ice Wood[5 Spear – S-Rank A spear made by a skilled craftsman using an old Ice Tree branch.<br />
It carries a powerful chill.<br />
It was an S-Rank weapon.<br />
It was a ratio increase, so it didn’t raise my stats much, but a new skill appeared.<br />
[Ice Attribute Reinforcement(S) Ice attribute reinforcement.<br />
That was also S-Rank.<br />
The one that came up when I used My Brat skill focused on Yerim was an A-Rank ice attribute reinforcement.<br />
To think it was an S-Rank attribute reinforcement.<br />
com for the best novel reading experience.<br />
So you finally made even an S-Rank weapon!When I sent him a gaze that was full of admiration, Myeonwoo shrugged his shoulders.  </p>
<p>Thankfully, I succeeded on my first attempt.<br />
Though I had to stay up the whole night.<br />
It’ll get a little easier starting from the second one.<br />
I didn’t know you would grow this fast.<br />
Like this, wouldn’t you immediately make an SS-Rank weapon, too.<br />
That should be a little difficult.<br />
Apparently Ismual can only help with up to S-Rank weapons.<br />
Still, there’s one thing that I’m preparing.<br />
As expected, SS-Rank equipment were difficult.<br />
Still, how far did he come? It was really impressive.  </p>
<p>Now there’s nothing more to delay.<br />
We should get your name known, too.<br />
Originally, I suggested to debut as a blacksmith Hunter once he made an A-Rank weapon, but Myeongwoo had refused.<br />
Saying that he would put himself forward after he had made an S-Rank.  </p>
<p>Okay.<br />
Now I can confidently put myself forward.<br />
comAdvertisements Myeongwoo nodded his head, smiling.<br />
I smiled back, and then remembered something I had put off.<br />
I should voluntarily tell him before it was too late.  </p>
<p>Myeongwoo.<br />
There’s something I need to say.<br />
What is it.<br />
Truthfully, we didn’t know each other originally.<br />
It seems like I made a mistake.<br />
I confessed, adding a justification.  </p>
<p>Really?Myeongwoo answered.<br />
And that was it.<br />
No, wait.<br />
Why was the reaction like this? [1 she says ‘jelly’ as in the eng word transliterated, which is the krnkonglish slang term, but in eng, ppl call the bottom of cats’ feet ‘toe beans’ so… [2 for the unicorns’ names, she used the eng words transliterated, as named so by yj, but here she uses the krn words, which are used to call a white animal, and to cutely call a black dog, respectively.<br />
The ‘blackie’ used here is a slightly diff pronounced word than what yj named the salamander (rip blackie) but they’re fundamentally the same words, with the exact same meanings.<br />
[3 she says the two colors in krn and I added the ‘-ie’ bc it’s weird not to for names in eng.  </p>

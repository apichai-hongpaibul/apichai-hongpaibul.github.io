<p>144 Part 2 This had to have been an invasion of privacy because Yoohyun and Irin were together all the time.<br />
Maybe it was about personal tastes, which I was a bit curious about.<br />
He might be a fan of a celebrity while pretending he had no hobbies.<br />
Did Yoohyun play any games? Yerim said she played a game in which she decorated things.  </p>
<p>No, I have none.<br />
Really? Your face says otherwise.<br />
I don’t.<br />
Yoohyun turned around, and his reaction said that there was something.<br />
While family members had to respect each other’s privacy, I wondered what his secret was.<br />
I hoped he was going on dates without telling me.<br />
I took out my phone to find Taewon Song’s number.<br />
Not being able to see well was inconvenient, so maybe I should get glasses as a temporary measure.<br />
He probably bought a new phone or connected a different one since he answered.<br />
Taewon Song told me that he was where the dungeon break had occurred when I told him I wanted to meet him concerning yesterday.  </p>
<p>Then, can I come over there.<br />
Yes, but it will not be a comfortable meet up.<br />
While there had been almost no casualties, things would be uncomfortable since it was an accident site.<br />
I was going out of the room after ending the call when Yoohyun grabbed my arm.<br />
com for a better experience.<br />
You said you couldn’t see well.<br />
I’ll help.<br />
I’m not blind, and I can get around.<br />
While I stumbled a few times on the stairs, I could manage myself on even ground.  </p>
<p>If you can’t see.<br />
Yes.<br />
It’s nothing.<br />
While my brother had mumbled, I could understand what he was thinking.<br />
While it had not happened yet, he had not healed my leg.  </p>
<p>I need to see because I want to see you and everyone else.<br />
Most of what I lived for would disappear if I could not see the children since I was feeling the strain of not being able to see Yoohyun clearly.<br />
I should get a pair of glasses on the way.<br />
com Soyoung Kang and other Sesung hunters, were waiting when we went outside the miniature portal.<br />
Their faces were filled with dread and worry since Hyunjae Sung had sent them to bring us clothes.  </p>
<p>Nothing…happened, right?Soyoung Kang asked with an expression that she desperately wanted an affirmative answer.<br />
While many things happened, I could not say anything specifically.  </p>
<p>The aquarium had burst.<br />
Oh! The aquarium will not burst under normal circumstances.<br />
We used it to put out a fire in the garden below due to light refraction.<br />
Oh, all right…I wanted things to go over smoothly, but Soyoung Kang and other hunters continued to glance at Yoohyun.<br />
He must look like Minyui Kim to them, and I wondered if something went wrong with the effect on the glasses.<br />
Odd gazes followed Yoohyun, or Minyui Kim until we got out of the Sesung Guild building.<br />
They did not approach us but followed him with observant eyes.<br />
Did you do something while I was gone.<br />
No, nothing happened.<br />
I went to Sesung Guild leader’s house with his permission.<br />
Then why were Sesung hunters acting like that? Was it because of the accident on the road? He had organized the site too easily for a supporting hunter.  </p>
<p>Hello, Hunter Minyui Kim.<br />
If it’s not too much trouble, would you receive this card?I met another guild employee who was giving out his card in the parking lot, although it was rude to approach a hunter who already belonged to another guild.<br />
A fight might ensue against a high-class hunter, but since Minyui Kim was a B class supporter, others could try to reach him.<br />
People might really be thinking that Minyui Kim did not have B class supporting stats because of what happened at the accident site.<br />
The guy would be mixed up in some complications when he came back.<br />
We politely refused the card and got a pair of glasses at a store before heading to the dungeon break site.<br />
The surrounding area was off-limits since there still might be monsters around.<br />
While the site had been chaotic at night, it was a battleground at midday.<br />
While the rain had stopped, it was still cloudy, and with the building ruins and cracked roads looked eerie like a scene from an apocalypse film.<br />
Well, the end of the world as we knew it might come for real.<br />
You came.<br />
Taewon Song came to us, and his gaze stopped on my face.  </p>
<p>Are those glasses prescribed.<br />
Yes, things happened.<br />
What had…Taewon Song stopped speaking and looked around.  </p>
<p>Let’s talk somewhere else.<br />
The convenience store is unlocked and empty since the employees were not able to lock it up before escaping.<br />
Let’s go there.<br />
There were tables and chairs in the store, and while large debris had fallen around, the glass walls were fortunately intact.<br />
I placed a wet bill on the counter after choosing a coffee.<br />
com for a better experience.<br />
Is this much all right?I asked as I handed a coffee to Taewon Song.<br />
It cost less than two thousand won because of a two-plus-one event, although I had left a ten thousand won bill for it.<br />
Taewon Song asked what had happened as soon as we sat on the chairs.  </p>
<p>It’s nothing.<br />
It’s because of the Sesung Guild leader.<br />
Yoohyun revealed the culprit as he sat next to me, and Taewon Song’s brow furrowed at the same time.  </p>
<p>Is it because of what happened last night.<br />
No, he escorted me home without any problems.<br />
I had gone to his house today.  </p>
<p>Yoohyun Han had gone there alone and suffered the consequences.<br />
My brother spoke in a sulky voice.<br />
You went there alone.<br />
Taewon Song sighed, and the two stared at me with similar eyes.<br />
So what? I could allow Yoohyun to look at me like that, but Taewon Song’s gaze was too intense for my tastes.  </p>
<p>I’m alright except for my eyes.<br />
Actually, I was going to track you down because of yesterday’s dungeon break.<br />
I continued as I put a straw in the coffee.  </p>
<p>Will you cooperate, interfere, or observe us?Taewon Song ripped the plastic wrapping from the straw as he stared at me.<br />
He drank a sip before opening his mouth to speak.  </p>
<p>I already said that I would protect you.<br />
So, he would be on my side if my safety were on the line.<br />
I would welcome the protection anyway.  </p>
<p>I have something to ask you.<br />
com I did not want to be forward, but I could not stifle my curiosity.  </p>
<p>If you gave the Sesung Guild leader something precious as a present before you died, why would you do so.<br />
What?Taewon Song stared at me like I was crazy, and Yoohyun looked at me as if I were sick.  </p>

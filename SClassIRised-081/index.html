<p>&lt; Demon King’s Spinning Wheel (2) &gt;</p>
<p>What is going on?!Suddenly, the door connected to the guardian room was opened, and Kim Sunghan poked his head in.
His gaze went to the Dokkaebi and then turned back to me.</p>
<p>A friend just came to visit.
Please do not mind it.
Are you alright?
Yes.
It is well known that the Dokkaebi is neutral.
It is alright.
It was the Dokkaebi with teleportation, who could teleport taking along a person at that.
From the point of view of protecting me, you couldn’t help but mind it.
Kim Sunghan was uneasy, but closed the door.
In the meantime, the Dokkaebi had been fiddling with the remote.</p>
<p>Boss, is there anything fun on?
No, not really.
com for a better experience Following the Dokkaebi, I moved my gaze to the TV.
On the news, it was saying that the overseas gathering that insisted that dungeons bursting open was something natural had terrorized the Hunter Association.
[Shouting that monsters being released through dungeon breaks were the providence of a god, they took up the streets- ‘So those people already appeared.
’ It felt like they had come out a long time after, originally.
Was it not? Since it was something from 5 years ago, my memory wasn’t exact.
They could’ve been running around from time to time before they became a full-fledged social problem.</p>
<p>What is this? It’s pretty!The Dokkaebi was eyeing the chocolate box on the table next to the bed.
It was what Sung Hyunjae had given.
I didn’t particularly like sweet things, but my mouth had nothing else to do, so I was just eating it, when half had disappeared.
Maybe because it was expensive, it was tasty too.</p>
<p>Chocolate.
You want some?
Yeah!They lifted the mask slightly and put in their mouth first, before they nodded their head.
They really did seem like a kid.
com Still, it was time to boss them around again.
While I had gone into the dungeon and was carried out, of course the rearing facility, but also the connected building had finished its interior repair.
The Suk Hayan team said that they had already moved to the building.
Since the data that was sent first was all organized, it was time to need new data.</p>
<p>Our loving Yoon Yoon, have you rested a lot during this time?When I spoke friendily, the hands picking up and eating the chocolate stopped.
Then they turned to look at me.</p>
<p>You were like that last time, but you really talk like my grandmother.
As expected, was it their grandmother? When I checked the My Brat skill window, (Yoon Yoon-B) had newly appeared.
Han Yoohyun, crazy guy.</p>
<p>You have to go investigate dungeons again, so eat a lot.
You can eat all of it.
If there’s anything you want to eat, just say.
Would I not be able to buy you anything? As long as you listen to me well, I will become the heart of a grandmother looking after her grandchild.
com I used the My Brat skill on the Dokkaebi, who was focusing on the chocolate again.
My heart was pounding at the thought of letting them get the ultra long distance gate skill, but, [They are an incomplete species[1.
A weird message popped up.
Huh? [In order for growth, an item similar to the relevant incomplete species’ structure is needed.
The completed species and the level of completion differs following the item’s characteristics and rank.
‘……Incomplete species.
If you calculate it out, it’s a new species altogether… it is, but.
’ They called themself the Dokkaebi, so I just casually overlooked it, but if I thought about it, they were a being that definitely wasn’t human.
Since there’s the system administrators and Myeongwoo’s Forge’s elemental, it wasn’t anything new.
Still, the only one who had solely come directly out of this world and was active, was the Dokkaebi.
…And there might be more too.
Anyways, an item that was similar to the structure.
Ah, maybe.
com I opened my inventory list.
I saw the Nameless Demon King’s Old Spinning Wheel.
‘It’s a wheel, similar to a waterwheel, and it’s an object that is old and was used.
And the rank is the high SS-Rank.
’ No matter how I looked at it, it seemed like it was given fitting this.
Could the system people’s influence have gone into this? There was no reason to refuse something already prepared, so I took out the spinning wheel from my inventory.</p>
<p>Yoon Yoon.
Hm?The Dokkaebi who had cleanly finished up the last chocolate, turned to look at me.
Seeing the spinning wheel in my hand, they tilted their head.</p>
<p>What’s that? It gives off a kind of weird feeling.
It’s an item necessary for your growth.
com for the best novel reading experience But how do I use it? Do I just give it to them? I passed the spinning wheel over to the Dokkaebi.
Holding that, the Dokkaebi doubtfully tilted their head again.</p>
<p>Nameless Demon King’s Old Spinning Wheel? It’s a demon king’s item? If it’s a demon king, then it’s really scary, right? With large horns, and is red, and really big and strong!
Well, something like that.
Then I want to be a demon king!It wasn’t even an nine-year-old’s future wish; was it okay to just suddenly change your species? For the future, a moment’s wrong choice-.
Ooooooong! The spinning wheel abruptly vibrated lightly and let out a dark red light.
I thought something was serious, so I held the sleeping Chirpie.</p>
<p>So it’s like that.
It’s really a demon king’s spinning wheel.
The Dokkaebi mumbled to themself.
It’s incredibly old.
Older than me.
…Yoon Yoon?It wouldn’t be that the spinning wheel would become the basis because it was older, or something like that, right? When I checked using the Seed-Leaf skill, it was still as always.</p>
<p>Alright, demon kings really are the scariest.
Right.
I will!Seureureu- The spinning wheel collapsed like a sand castle, and seeped into the Dokkaebi’s palms, their body.
Was it okay to just leave it like this? Should I block it? Of course, I couldn’t block it and I was about to call Kim Sunghan, but Yoon Yoon’s status window changed.
com Awakened Person Yoon Yoon’s written part had changed to like a monster’s.
The stats were also SS-Rank.
Besides that, to think it was demon race – even up to 5 years later, that hadn’t ever come out once! 
Dokkaebi!
I’m a demon king!Goooong! Yoon Yoon’s body became bigger as if swelling.
At the same time, a gloomy air burst out like it was surging.
The furniture made loud noises as they broke, fell over, Jjujuk- Fine fissures appeared in the Hunter exclusive hospital’s VIP room’s special walls.
‘…There’s no damage to me.
’ It was probably at the level of a straw house in front of a typhoon against an SS-Rank, but I used the B-Rank shielding skill.
But not a single edge of the raging power touched the shielding.
com ‘Is their personality the same?’ This grandmother was happy.
I was thinking it was a relief and was withdrawing the shielding in order to talk, when, Bam! 
What is going on?!Actually breaking down the bent door that had been rammed with a table, Kim Sunghan ran in.
In the meantime, Yoon Yoon had completely changed.
It was the image that commonly came to mind for a demon king.
It was exactly that.
A curving pair of large horns and giant membrane wings.
Wavering pitch black hair above the red skin, a rough-looking face, and canines jutting out.
The body that had become about three to four times the size of a human, had bulging muscles and was surrounded by clothes that were wavering around like black fog.
Sharp claws and even a long tail similar to that of a reptile.
Their imagination was a little lacking.
Besides that, all of their optimized initial skills had changed.
Even just glancing at the skill names, all of them were combat related.
Han Yoojin-ssi! Hurry, ugh!Kim Sunghan, who tried to run toward me, was wrapped in the edges of the black fog.
I was momentarily taken aback from the behavior that wasn’t like Yoon Yoon, but they were just restraining him, and no attacks were inflicted.
Kim Sunghan struggled to get free no matter what, but the fog edges didn’t move one bit.
The difference in rank was too big.
On top of that, they had the title of demon king, so wouldn’t they be high grade among SS-Ranks? Even just looking at the possible Awakening rank, it wasn’t S~SS but exactly SS.
It meant that its rank was higher than the Babar.</p>
<p>Yoon Yoon.
-Geureureureu At my call, the demon king let out a heavy rumbling.
It wouldn’t be that they couldn’t speak because they became affiliated to monsters, right? The demon king that turned their head towards me heaved their body, and then opened their mouth and yelled.
-It’s scary, right!! 
No.
com -……Why? Why isn’t it scary? The demon king’s expression became sullen.
The incredibly wrinkled face reminded me of a bulldog, so even laughter spilled out.
It was a relief.
The inside was still the same.
They were still our Yoon Yoon.
I put on an extremely leisurely smile and replied.</p>
<p>You were much scarier when you were a dokkaebi.
Do you remember when we first met? I was shocked to death.
-But I’m a demon king? Isn’t a demon king scarier than a dokkaebi? 
Look at me.
Do I look scared?-Noo.
The demon king shook their head even more gloomily.
Don’t act cute with that face and that voice.
Cute.
But you were scary when you were a dokkaebi.
You remember me being frightened, right?-You weren’t scared after that! 
Everything becomes not scary once you get used to it.
But I wasn’t alarmed even though it was my first time seeing a demon king.
So, obviously, a dokkaebi is scarier! That ahjussi also was alarmed because I might get hurt; it wasn’t that he was scared of you.
The demon king turned to look at Kim Sunghan.
Kim Sunghan quick-wittedly nodded his head.
-…Eh, demon kings are boring.</p>
<p>They are boring.
And they’re too common, and they have no individuality.
It wasn’t that I was looking down on an SS-Rank demon king.
But a dokkaebi was better than a demon king.
Putting aside the skills, above all, it was obvious that if I let the demon king loose like this, they would start to run rampant.
Just seeing how they immediately subdued Kim Sunghan, their aggression definitely increased.
On top of that, if they went outside and swung their arms a little, they would quickly realize how much people were scared of them, unlike what I said.
An aggressive demon king that liked scaring people.
com for a better experience -Then I want to be a dokkaebi.
A dokkaebi king! The demon king that had yelled cheerfully with a husky voice started to change their form.
Along with that, Yoon Yoon’s status window changed again.
com Guess Who?(S) Acquired Cloud Steps(B) Acquired The stat rank had been lowered to S.
Compared to before, it had leapt up.
The optimized initial skills also had two more compared to before.
The Dokkaebi Door seemed like the ultra long distance gate skill, but, ‘Progenitor of the Dokkaebi Race?’ On top of that it was L-Rank.
Even the demon king didn’t have an L-Rank skill.
In the meantime, the demon king, no the dokkaebi king’s appearance had completely changed.</p>
<p>This is the appearance of the Great Dokkaebi King!The voice that was higher and more ringing than before, laughed cheerfully.
It was a voice that weirdly tickled your heart.
The hair that was fluttering around like when they were the demon king, had changed to pure white.
The mask had broken so the face was exposed.
com They had clear blue eyes and the ends of the white eyebrows were long.
It was still hard to tell the gender of the fancy-but-white-porcelain-like appearance filled with elegance.
Even the baggy clothes that seemed like it was made from colorful cloth connected together, was ambiguous, other than that it was Eastern.</p>
<p>Mr.
Kim can have this!The Dokkaebi King took off the demon king’s horns that were left on their head and tossed it to the bed.
I stopped soothing Chirpie, who had woken up and was fussing, and picked up one of the horns and checked the information window.
[Disappeared Demon King’s Right Horn – SS-Rank It is the remaining horn of the demon king that completely ceased to exist down to the last piece.
‘Last piece’, so it wasn’t a normal spinning wheel.
This was definitely a material item.
I should give it to Myeongwoo.</p>
<p>Can I know what your new skills are?
Yeah! They’re-.
Yoon Yoon, who was going to continue speaking, turned to look at Kim Sunghan.
Kim Sunghan, who was searching the mood without taking his eyes off the Dokkaebi King, reflexively frowned.
Sunghan-ssi, could you excuse us for a moment? And it seems like an explanation about the situation will be necessary outside since the noise was quite loud.
Is it safe?
Yes, it is fine.
Just, um.
Something like an Awakening event? It was something like a passing gust of wind.
It is fine now.
Kim Sunghan hesitated and then left the hospital room.
Yoon Yoon nodded their head and continued speaking again.</p>
<p>Progenitor of the Dokkaebi Race and Dokkaebi Door and Dokkaebi Mask.
Maybe thanks to the keyword effect, they obediently spilled it all in front of me.</p>
<p>Dokkaebi Mask is this!Going ‘ta-da’, Yoon Yoon’s appearance… changed to my appearance.
The face and height and body shape were all the same.
Even the clothes were the hospital gown.
Chirpie cheeped and was surprised.
No, no.
That’s not dad.
When I held up Chirpie, who was struggling, trying to go to Yoon Yoon, and showed it my face, its two eyes became round.
-Chi…rp? 
Turn back to normal.
The kid is startled.
…Can you change gender too?
Completely!Yoon Yoon said, turning back to their appearance.</p>
<p>Though skills and stats don’t work.
If even those worked, then it would be a scam.
But outwardly, it was really a complete transformation.</p>
<p>Keep that skill hidden well.
What? How can I hide something this fun? I should use it!That wasn’t good.
Seeing how they were excited, it would be no use even if I coaxed them.
Well, it was a type that could be used even if it was revealed.</p>
<p>Dokkaebi Door is making a door that can go really far away.
It has to be a place I’ve been to, and once every 10 days!
Please don’t use it normally, if it’s possible.
It’ll be bad if you can’t use it when it’s urgent.
I’ll try~.
I didn’t believe them.
If you’ve become a king, then change a little.
Anyways, if it had to be someplace they’ve been, I should make them travel a lot even if it wasn’t for the dungeon investigations.
Advertisements 
And lastly, a skill for making my subordinates!
Subordinates?
Yeah, subordinates~ or subjects? So anyways, Boss Mr.
Kim! I’m busy now! I have to go find things that are old and were used for a long time and thrown away.
…Could it be that you can make dokkaebi? Yoon Yoon, you?Yoon Yoon nodded their head hard.
Wow… was that okay? Unlike monsters, you could communicate and they weren’t aggressive, but it seemed like a new group of beings would suddenly pop up.</p>
<p>Do you have to make them immediately starting right now?
Yeah! Since I’m a king.
It’s my responsibility and duty!The voice was cheerful, but the gleam in their eyes were quite earnest.
And they weren’t a guy who would listen even if you dissuaded them.
Did I have to buy land and make something like a dokkaebi village? How many would there be? At any rate, since they said they had to be things that were thrown away, they wouldn’t be robbing museums.</p>
<p>I’ll come back after making a lot of subordinates~.
I quickly grabbed Yoon Yoon who was about to leave after saying bye-bye.</p>
<p>If you’re going to find them, a place with a big population really would be good.
Go to China.
While you’re there, investigate dungeons too.
Hm?Work, work.
Normally, kings that were born on this ground had to work to the bone.
In the end, the Dokkaebi King promised they would also investigate dungeon and disappeared.</p>

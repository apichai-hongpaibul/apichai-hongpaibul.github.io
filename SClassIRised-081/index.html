<p>&lt; Demon King’s Spinning Wheel (2) .  </p>
<p>What is going on?!Suddenly, the door connected to the guardian room was opened, and Kim Sunghan poked his head in.<br />
His gaze went to the Dokkaebi and then turned back to me.  </p>
<p>A friend just came to visit.<br />
Please do not mind it.<br />
Are you alright.<br />
Yes.<br />
It is well known that the Dokkaebi is neutral.<br />
It is alright.<br />
It was the Dokkaebi with teleportation, who could teleport taking along a person at that.<br />
From the point of view of protecting me, you couldn’t help but mind it.<br />
Kim Sunghan was uneasy, but closed the door.<br />
In the meantime, the Dokkaebi had been fiddling with the remote.  </p>
<p>Boss, is there anything fun on.<br />
No, not really.<br />
com for a better experience Following the Dokkaebi, I moved my gaze to the TV.<br />
On the news, it was saying that the overseas gathering that insisted that dungeons bursting open was something natural had terrorized the Hunter Association.<br />
[Shouting that monsters being released through dungeon breaks were the providence of a god, they took up the streets- ‘So those people already appeared.<br />
’ It felt like they had come out a long time after, originally.<br />
Was it not? Since it was something from 5 years ago, my memory wasn’t exact.<br />
They could’ve been running around from time to time before they became a full-fledged social problem.  </p>
<p>What is this? It’s pretty!The Dokkaebi was eyeing the chocolate box on the table next to the bed.<br />
It was what Sung Hyunjae had given.<br />
I didn’t particularly like sweet things, but my mouth had nothing else to do, so I was just eating it, when half had disappeared.<br />
Maybe because it was expensive, it was tasty too.  </p>
<p>Chocolate.<br />
You want some.<br />
Yeah!They lifted the mask slightly and put in their mouth first, before they nodded their head.<br />
They really did seem like a kid.<br />
com Still, it was time to boss them around again.<br />
While I had gone into the dungeon and was carried out, of course the rearing facility, but also the connected building had finished its interior repair.<br />
The Suk Hayan team said that they had already moved to the building.<br />
Since the data that was sent first was all organized, it was time to need new data.  </p>
<p>Our loving Yoon Yoon, have you rested a lot during this time?When I spoke friendily, the hands picking up and eating the chocolate stopped.<br />
Then they turned to look at me.  </p>
<p>You were like that last time, but you really talk like my grandmother.<br />
As expected, was it their grandmother? When I checked the My Brat skill window, (Yoon Yoon-B) had newly appeared.<br />
Han Yoohyun, crazy guy.  </p>
<p>You have to go investigate dungeons again, so eat a lot.<br />
You can eat all of it.<br />
If there’s anything you want to eat, just say.<br />
Would I not be able to buy you anything? As long as you listen to me well, I will become the heart of a grandmother looking after her grandchild.<br />
com I used the My Brat skill on the Dokkaebi, who was focusing on the chocolate again.<br />
My heart was pounding at the thought of letting them get the ultra long distance gate skill, but, [They are an incomplete species[1.<br />
A weird message popped up.<br />
Huh? [In order for growth, an item similar to the relevant incomplete species’ structure is needed.<br />
The completed species and the level of completion differs following the item’s characteristics and rank.<br />
‘……Incomplete species.<br />
If you calculate it out, it’s a new species altogether… it is, but.<br />
’ They called themself the Dokkaebi, so I just casually overlooked it, but if I thought about it, they were a being that definitely wasn’t human.<br />
Since there’s the system administrators and Myeongwoo’s Forge’s elemental, it wasn’t anything new.<br />
Still, the only one who had solely come directly out of this world and was active, was the Dokkaebi.<br />
…And there might be more too.<br />
Anyways, an item that was similar to the structure.<br />
Ah, maybe.<br />
com I opened my inventory list.<br />
I saw the Nameless Demon King’s Old Spinning Wheel.<br />
‘It’s a wheel, similar to a waterwheel, and it’s an object that is old and was used.<br />
And the rank is the high SS-Rank.<br />
’ No matter how I looked at it, it seemed like it was given fitting this.<br />
Could the system people’s influence have gone into this? There was no reason to refuse something already prepared, so I took out the spinning wheel from my inventory.  </p>
<p>Yoon Yoon.<br />
Hm?The Dokkaebi who had cleanly finished up the last chocolate, turned to look at me.<br />
Seeing the spinning wheel in my hand, they tilted their head.  </p>
<p>What’s that? It gives off a kind of weird feeling.<br />
It’s an item necessary for your growth.<br />
com for the best novel reading experience But how do I use it? Do I just give it to them? I passed the spinning wheel over to the Dokkaebi.<br />
Holding that, the Dokkaebi doubtfully tilted their head again.  </p>
<p>Nameless Demon King’s Old Spinning Wheel? It’s a demon king’s item? If it’s a demon king, then it’s really scary, right? With large horns, and is red, and really big and strong.<br />
Well, something like that.<br />
Then I want to be a demon king!It wasn’t even an nine-year-old’s future wish; was it okay to just suddenly change your species? For the future, a moment’s wrong choice-.<br />
Ooooooong! The spinning wheel abruptly vibrated lightly and let out a dark red light.<br />
I thought something was serious, so I held the sleeping Chirpie.  </p>
<p>So it’s like that.<br />
It’s really a demon king’s spinning wheel.<br />
The Dokkaebi mumbled to themself.<br />
It’s incredibly old.<br />
Older than me.<br />
…Yoon Yoon?It wouldn’t be that the spinning wheel would become the basis because it was older, or something like that, right? When I checked using the Seed-Leaf skill, it was still as always.  </p>
<p>Alright, demon kings really are the scariest.<br />
Right.<br />
I will!Seureureu- The spinning wheel collapsed like a sand castle, and seeped into the Dokkaebi’s palms, their body.<br />
Was it okay to just leave it like this? Should I block it? Of course, I couldn’t block it and I was about to call Kim Sunghan, but Yoon Yoon’s status window changed.<br />
com Awakened Person Yoon Yoon’s written part had changed to like a monster’s.<br />
The stats were also SS-Rank.<br />
Besides that, to think it was demon race – even up to 5 years later, that hadn’t ever come out once!.<br />
Dokkaebi.<br />
I’m a demon king!Goooong! Yoon Yoon’s body became bigger as if swelling.<br />
At the same time, a gloomy air burst out like it was surging.<br />
The furniture made loud noises as they broke, fell over, Jjujuk- Fine fissures appeared in the Hunter exclusive hospital’s VIP room’s special walls.<br />
‘…There’s no damage to me.<br />
’ It was probably at the level of a straw house in front of a typhoon against an SS-Rank, but I used the B-Rank shielding skill.<br />
But not a single edge of the raging power touched the shielding.<br />
com ‘Is their personality the same?’ This grandmother was happy.<br />
I was thinking it was a relief and was withdrawing the shielding in order to talk, when, Bam!.<br />
What is going on?!Actually breaking down the bent door that had been rammed with a table, Kim Sunghan ran in.<br />
In the meantime, Yoon Yoon had completely changed.<br />
It was the image that commonly came to mind for a demon king.<br />
It was exactly that.<br />
A curving pair of large horns and giant membrane wings.<br />
Wavering pitch black hair above the red skin, a rough-looking face, and canines jutting out.<br />
The body that had become about three to four times the size of a human, had bulging muscles and was surrounded by clothes that were wavering around like black fog.<br />
Sharp claws and even a long tail similar to that of a reptile.<br />
Their imagination was a little lacking.<br />
Besides that, all of their optimized initial skills had changed.<br />
Even just glancing at the skill names, all of them were combat related.<br />
Han Yoojin-ssi! Hurry, ugh!Kim Sunghan, who tried to run toward me, was wrapped in the edges of the black fog.<br />
I was momentarily taken aback from the behavior that wasn’t like Yoon Yoon, but they were just restraining him, and no attacks were inflicted.<br />
Kim Sunghan struggled to get free no matter what, but the fog edges didn’t move one bit.<br />
The difference in rank was too big.<br />
On top of that, they had the title of demon king, so wouldn’t they be high grade among SS-Ranks? Even just looking at the possible Awakening rank, it wasn’t S~SS but exactly SS.<br />
It meant that its rank was higher than the Babar.  </p>
<p>Yoon Yoon.<br />
-Geureureureu At my call, the demon king let out a heavy rumbling.<br />
It wouldn’t be that they couldn’t speak because they became affiliated to monsters, right? The demon king that turned their head towards me heaved their body, and then opened their mouth and yelled.<br />
-It’s scary, right!!.<br />
No.<br />
com -……Why? Why isn’t it scary? The demon king’s expression became sullen.<br />
The incredibly wrinkled face reminded me of a bulldog, so even laughter spilled out.<br />
It was a relief.<br />
The inside was still the same.<br />
They were still our Yoon Yoon.<br />
I put on an extremely leisurely smile and replied.  </p>
<p>You were much scarier when you were a dokkaebi.<br />
Do you remember when we first met? I was shocked to death.<br />
-But I’m a demon king? Isn’t a demon king scarier than a dokkaebi?.<br />
Look at me.<br />
Do I look scared?-Noo.<br />
The demon king shook their head even more gloomily.<br />
Don’t act cute with that face and that voice.<br />
Cute.<br />
But you were scary when you were a dokkaebi.<br />
You remember me being frightened, right?-You weren’t scared after that!.<br />
Everything becomes not scary once you get used to it.<br />
But I wasn’t alarmed even though it was my first time seeing a demon king.<br />
So, obviously, a dokkaebi is scarier! That ahjussi also was alarmed because I might get hurt; it wasn’t that he was scared of you.<br />
The demon king turned to look at Kim Sunghan.<br />
Kim Sunghan quick-wittedly nodded his head.<br />
-…Eh, demon kings are boring.  </p>
<p>They are boring.<br />
And they’re too common, and they have no individuality.<br />
It wasn’t that I was looking down on an SS-Rank demon king.<br />
But a dokkaebi was better than a demon king.<br />
Putting aside the skills, above all, it was obvious that if I let the demon king loose like this, they would start to run rampant.<br />
Just seeing how they immediately subdued Kim Sunghan, their aggression definitely increased.<br />
On top of that, if they went outside and swung their arms a little, they would quickly realize how much people were scared of them, unlike what I said.<br />
An aggressive demon king that liked scaring people.<br />
com for a better experience -Then I want to be a dokkaebi.<br />
A dokkaebi king! The demon king that had yelled cheerfully with a husky voice started to change their form.<br />
Along with that, Yoon Yoon’s status window changed again.<br />
com Guess Who?(S) Acquired Cloud Steps(B) Acquired The stat rank had been lowered to S.<br />
Compared to before, it had leapt up.<br />
The optimized initial skills also had two more compared to before.<br />
The Dokkaebi Door seemed like the ultra long distance gate skill, but, ‘Progenitor of the Dokkaebi Race?’ On top of that it was L-Rank.<br />
Even the demon king didn’t have an L-Rank skill.<br />
In the meantime, the demon king, no the dokkaebi king’s appearance had completely changed.  </p>
<p>This is the appearance of the Great Dokkaebi King!The voice that was higher and more ringing than before, laughed cheerfully.<br />
It was a voice that weirdly tickled your heart.<br />
The hair that was fluttering around like when they were the demon king, had changed to pure white.<br />
The mask had broken so the face was exposed.<br />
com They had clear blue eyes and the ends of the white eyebrows were long.<br />
It was still hard to tell the gender of the fancy-but-white-porcelain-like appearance filled with elegance.<br />
Even the baggy clothes that seemed like it was made from colorful cloth connected together, was ambiguous, other than that it was Eastern.  </p>
<p>Mr.<br />
Kim can have this!The Dokkaebi King took off the demon king’s horns that were left on their head and tossed it to the bed.<br />
I stopped soothing Chirpie, who had woken up and was fussing, and picked up one of the horns and checked the information window.<br />
[Disappeared Demon King’s Right Horn – SS-Rank It is the remaining horn of the demon king that completely ceased to exist down to the last piece.<br />
‘Last piece’, so it wasn’t a normal spinning wheel.<br />
This was definitely a material item.<br />
I should give it to Myeongwoo.  </p>
<p>Can I know what your new skills are.<br />
Yeah! They’re-.<br />
Yoon Yoon, who was going to continue speaking, turned to look at Kim Sunghan.<br />
Kim Sunghan, who was searching the mood without taking his eyes off the Dokkaebi King, reflexively frowned.<br />
Sunghan-ssi, could you excuse us for a moment? And it seems like an explanation about the situation will be necessary outside since the noise was quite loud.<br />
Is it safe.<br />
Yes, it is fine.<br />
Just, um.<br />
Something like an Awakening event? It was something like a passing gust of wind.<br />
It is fine now.<br />
Kim Sunghan hesitated and then left the hospital room.<br />
Yoon Yoon nodded their head and continued speaking again.  </p>
<p>Progenitor of the Dokkaebi Race and Dokkaebi Door and Dokkaebi Mask.<br />
Maybe thanks to the keyword effect, they obediently spilled it all in front of me.  </p>
<p>Dokkaebi Mask is this!Going ‘ta-da’, Yoon Yoon’s appearance… changed to my appearance.<br />
The face and height and body shape were all the same.<br />
Even the clothes were the hospital gown.<br />
Chirpie cheeped and was surprised.<br />
No, no.<br />
That’s not dad.<br />
When I held up Chirpie, who was struggling, trying to go to Yoon Yoon, and showed it my face, its two eyes became round.<br />
-Chi…rp?.<br />
Turn back to normal.<br />
The kid is startled.<br />
…Can you change gender too.<br />
Completely!Yoon Yoon said, turning back to their appearance.  </p>
<p>Though skills and stats don’t work.<br />
If even those worked, then it would be a scam.<br />
But outwardly, it was really a complete transformation.  </p>
<p>Keep that skill hidden well.<br />
What? How can I hide something this fun? I should use it!That wasn’t good.<br />
Seeing how they were excited, it would be no use even if I coaxed them.<br />
Well, it was a type that could be used even if it was revealed.  </p>
<p>Dokkaebi Door is making a door that can go really far away.<br />
It has to be a place I’ve been to, and once every 10 days.<br />
Please don’t use it normally, if it’s possible.<br />
It’ll be bad if you can’t use it when it’s urgent.<br />
I’ll try~.<br />
I didn’t believe them.<br />
If you’ve become a king, then change a little.<br />
Anyways, if it had to be someplace they’ve been, I should make them travel a lot even if it wasn’t for the dungeon investigations.<br />
Advertisements.<br />
And lastly, a skill for making my subordinates.<br />
Subordinates.<br />
Yeah, subordinates~ or subjects? So anyways, Boss Mr.<br />
Kim! I’m busy now! I have to go find things that are old and were used for a long time and thrown away.<br />
…Could it be that you can make dokkaebi? Yoon Yoon, you?Yoon Yoon nodded their head hard.<br />
Wow… was that okay? Unlike monsters, you could communicate and they weren’t aggressive, but it seemed like a new group of beings would suddenly pop up.  </p>
<p>Do you have to make them immediately starting right now.<br />
Yeah! Since I’m a king.<br />
It’s my responsibility and duty!The voice was cheerful, but the gleam in their eyes were quite earnest.<br />
And they weren’t a guy who would listen even if you dissuaded them.<br />
Did I have to buy land and make something like a dokkaebi village? How many would there be? At any rate, since they said they had to be things that were thrown away, they wouldn’t be robbing museums.  </p>
<p>I’ll come back after making a lot of subordinates~.<br />
I quickly grabbed Yoon Yoon who was about to leave after saying bye-bye.  </p>
<p>If you’re going to find them, a place with a big population really would be good.<br />
Go to China.<br />
While you’re there, investigate dungeons too.<br />
Hm?Work, work.<br />
Normally, kings that were born on this ground had to work to the bone.<br />
In the end, the Dokkaebi King promised they would also investigate dungeon and disappeared.  </p>

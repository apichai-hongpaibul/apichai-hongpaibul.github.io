<h1 id="vocanic-age-chapter-23">Vocanic Age Chapter 23</h1>
<p>Editor: Summerstood, Imagine
Guizhou, Weng An
The number of martial artists located in Weng An was about a thousand.
 four hundred belonged to the Murim Association and six hundred to the Death Faction.
 Its not even a battle between the Righteous and Death faction so why is Guizhou the only place that isnt peaceful and is always at war?
Zhuge Seung Kye mumbled with a doubtful voice.</p>
<p>It wasnt that a battle occurred for a short while, it continued for tens of years.</p>
<p>Murim was maintaining peace because of the balance of power and war didnt occur because of that so it was weird why only Guizhou was like this.
 Guizhou is a balance that differentiates the territory of the Righteous and Death faction.
 Even if they had agreed to a ceasefire agreement, it was obvious as to what would happen if you left martial artists together while fretting for not having been able to kill each other in the front lines.</p>
<p>Ju Seo Cheon cleared up Zhuge Seung Kyes doubts.</p>
<p>‘I heard that he was only interested in the Arts of Machinery.
 To think that the rumor was true.
 He doesnt know anything about the situation in Murim.
 I will have to engrave it in his head even if I have to use force later.
 It will be troublesome if he doesnt even have the basic knowledge.</p>
<p>He would have loved to scold him and tell him to at least memorize that much but he had to get close with him now.
 There is no need to stimulate a kid that is filled with enmity and caution.</p>
<p>No matter how you try to control them, martial artists have favor and spite.
 That monster-like emotion paralyzes even your rationality and this is the result of that.</p>
<p>Ju Seo Cheon put on a smile that didnt suit his age.</p>
<p>Guizhou is a place that is especially like that.
 It Favored spite endlessly until it became uncontrollable.
 It means that no one is able to cut this cycle you genius.</p>
<p>Ahemm, genius? Your intentions are too obvious but it doesnt feel bad.</p>
<p>Zhuge Seung Kyes lips curled up until it reached his ear globes.</p>
<p>‘Huhu, simple brat.</p>
<p>Ju Seo Cheon smiled inwardly.
 Kids were beings that were easy to handle.</p>
<p>…Wait.</p>
<p>A shadow was cast on the face of the smiling Zhuge Seung Kye.</p>
<p>You didnt mean that I was a genius in a different way, right? Indeed, if uncle had sent you those words would certainly be right.
 Telling me that its a useless talent and to give up.</p>
<p>‘Haa, hes starting again.</p>
<p>Zhuge Seung Kye had shown interest in the Arts of Machinery since he started to learn how to read.
 He didnt mind about people keeping him back and continued to delve himself deeper into the Arts of Machinery.</p>
<p>The scolding of the Zhuge Sega didnt end there and so his confidence turned into insecurity.</p>
<p>This was all because of his negative way of thinking.
 He had been cursed so much that he couldnt believe in compliments.</p>
<p>At times he was so simple and easy to soothe but even that faded out and all kinds of negativeness appeared.</p>
<p>Little brother, just accept it.
 You should also know it if you have ears but I am also a freak in Mount Hua.
 Your good brother must have already told you this, didnt you hear it?
Yeah…the only one that speak to me are my uncle and you…
Zhuge Seung Kye answered with dead eyes.</p>
<p>Originally Zhuge Sang did speak to him at times but that stopped when he joined with the group of Mount Hua.</p>
<p>Zhuge Sang cared about the conversation he had with the members of the Lotus Peak if it was for establishing a connection with Mount Hua sect.</p>
<p>Zhuge Suran didnt dislike Zhuge Seung Kye but he didnt speak to him as he was treated like a non-existent person.
 As that happened, the only ones that spoke to him were Zhuge Sak and Ju Seo Cheon.
 But most of Zhuge Saks words were scolding.</p>
<p>You are so cowardly for having stated the truth! Dont use the truth in a fair way and lets decide victory with lies and schemes!
Zhuge Seung Kye started to speak nonsense.</p>
<p>‘Based on the rumors he was really immature, but for that to be true…Is he really the Late Known Partner of Heaven?
It was at a level where it made him uneasy.</p>
<p>He had never seen his skills in the Arts of Machinery so at this point it was starting to worry him.</p>
<p>‘No, lets leave it.
 Lets believe in him.
 If I dont do so then who will believe in this freak?
Ju Seo Cheon shook his head and shook off his doubts.</p>
<p>Whats wrong? Are you crazy?
Zhuge Seung Kye looked at Ju Seo Cheon and got away from him.</p>
<p>He wanted to hit him.</p>
<p>Most martial artists of Weng An came from small and middle sized sects.
 And the one in command was a first class warrior of the Murim Association.</p>
<p>Welcome!
The first class warrior, Wang Chil welcomed the arriving reinforcements magnanimously.
 He was that happy about their existence.</p>
<p>When he heard the nickname Fourteenth Gallant Sword tears started to form in his eyes.</p>
<p>I have only a vague understanding of the situation so explain.</p>
<p>Zhuge Sak said.</p>
<p>Yes!
Six hundred of the Death Faction and four hundred of the Murim Association.</p>
<p>People that didnt know about Murim would think that the Death Faction held the upper hand looking at the difference in forces.
 But anyone that had a little bit of knowledge about Murim would say that the Murim Association was the one with the upper hand.</p>
<p>The forces of the River of Death were so great it could be seen as being overwhelming.</p>
<p>But the only overwhelming thing was their number.</p>
<p>If you were to pick the most representative characteristic of the Death Factions martial arts was that it was quite fast to complete it but instead, you would face a wall that appeared at a certain section so it was really hard to overcome it.</p>
<p>Thats why they had a lot of low leveled martial artists, they had much less experts or middle tier martial artists than the Righteous Faction.</p>
<p>Even though their quality was low, they still had numbers so it was hard to determine victory or defeat with just that.</p>
<p>Did an expert of the Death Faction come to Weng An?
Gu Pung asked directly.</p>
<p>If there was a difference of two hundred people, the difference wasnt that great to get pushed back one sidedly.
 Rather than speaking about defeat, they could be aiming for victory if they did well.</p>
<p>But the reason they requested for reinforcements meant that there was another disadvantageous reason besides number.</p>
<p>Yes.
 Three of them.</p>
<p>The faces of Gu Pung and Zhuge Sak hardened at Wang Chils answer.</p>
<p>Ah, but there are no pinnacle experts so you can rest assured.</p>
<p>Someone that could be called an expert had to be at the Pinnacle Rank at least.</p>
<p>The boundary beyond that, and especially the top hundred experts inside the Transcendent rank received another nickname.</p>
<p>Zhuge Sak let out a sigh of relief and then shouted while getting angry.</p>
<p>Tell us about them first!
It would be a problem if there was even a peak expert among the three.
 Not even Gu Pung could be sure of their victory.</p>
<p>But if all of them were at the 1st rank, they would somehow be able to take care of them, although it may be bothersome.</p>
<p>If they didnt get any obstructions, he would be able to face all three of them.</p>
<p>Good, lets check the situation first and then decide on how…
Zhuge Sak was about to set up a strategy.</p>
<p>Its an emergency!
But he had to stop due to someone yelling.</p>
<p>Whats wrong?
We received news that the Three Headed Mad Dog have appeared at the second clash and are running wild at the front lines!
Even though they were called three headed, it didnt mean that they had three heads.
 There were three insane brothers that committed all kinds of atrocities and were called the Three Headed Mad Dog.
 All three of them were at the peak rank.</p>
<p>It seems like we wont be having spare time.</p>
<p>Gu Pung let out a sigh and stood up from his seat.</p>
<p>Gulp.</p>
<p>Jang Hong gulped.
 His face was completely stiff by the tension and it was no different for Jang Seo Eun.</p>
<p>Even if they were disciples of Mount Hua, everyone would get nervous at the first real battle they would experience.</p>
<p>I will leave the two of them at your care.</p>
<p>Gu Pung entrusted the two soldiers that belonged to the Murim Association and had accompanied them since Guiyang.</p>
<p>Yes great master.</p>
<p>Just leave it to us.</p>
<p>Before they left for Guiyang, they had received the role of acting as escorts that would act instead of Gu Pung from Shin Do Gyun.</p>
<p>Thanks to that Gu Pung could get a bit relieved.</p>
<p>Two?
Ju Seo Cheon tilted his head.</p>
<p>Umm, im sorry for not having told you beforehand.</p>
<p>Gu Pung apologized to Ju Seo Cheon before leaving the tent.</p>
<p>I would also like to take you with us but the situation doesnt allow that.
 It seems like the warriors that have accompanied us since Guiyang wont be able to handle three people.
 Thats why I have to unavoidably leave you here as the youngest of them.</p>
<p>He had no reason to take Ju Seo Cheon to the battlefield so it was unavoidable even if he felt it was unfair.</p>
<p>‘Mm, I had been looking forward to it so its a bit regretful.</p>
<p>He wanted to test the martial arts he had trained in so hard until now.
 At the Lotus Peak he sparred at times with Nak Seo Wol when she sneaked in but it wasnt that he had shown his true skills.</p>
<p>An opportunity to participate in the battlefield had appeared so he was planning to sneak out alone to fight as the battlefield would become chaotic anyways.</p>
<p>It was an obvious thing but he didnt feel nervous due to fear like Jang Seo Eun or Jang Hong.</p>
<p>Ju Seo Cheon had also managed to stay alive by fighting at the age of war even though he wasnt as great as the heroes.</p>
<p>There was no one in Mount Hua that had more real experience than Ju Seo Cheon.</p>
<p>It wasnt called the age of war for nothing.
 It meant that there were THAT many battles.</p>
<p>Its a decision I came up with while thinking of your safety so dont think im so heartless.
 Its not that Im looking down on you.</p>
<p>I already know, senior uncle.
 Thank you for thinking about me.
 It was an unavoidable decision.</p>
<p>Ju Seo Cheon nodded in an understanding way.</p>
<p>You are only twelve but you are already grown up.
 This master of yours has a really good disciple.
 Ah, the youngest one of the Zhuge Sega will also stay behind so you should take care of him well.
 I request this to you.</p>
<p>Yes, senior uncle.
 Take care out there.
 I will pray for your safety.</p>
<p>A place called Kae An appeared after walking half a day from Weng An.
 It was a region where small regions were gathered at.</p>
<p>This place was at the boundary region between the Murim Association and the River of Death and was a place that occurred several times in a day.</p>
<p>The reinforcements that departed from Weng Ang marched the fastest they could and arrived at Kae Ang.</p>
<p>Waaaaa!
Its the Fourteenth Gallant Sword.</p>
<p>As soon as Gu Pung made his appearance, cheers that were so loud it could burst your eardrums exploded among the warriors of the Murim Association.</p>
<p>The name of the Fourteenth Gallant Sword was that reliable.
 Even the River of Death flinched at that spirit.</p>
<p>Gu Pung stood at the front line and displayed the Fourteen Stances of the Plum Blossom Sword.</p>
<p>The sword of a pinnacle rank wasnt normal at all.</p>
<p>Warriors of the Death Faction screamed everytime his sword passed by and blood was sprayed.</p>
<p>Haha, they are nothing much!
Zhuge Sak observed the battlefield and laughed.</p>
<p>There was no need to even set up a plan.
 The Fourteenth Gallant Sword and all the forces that came from Kae Yang boasted a burning martial prowess.</p>
<p>………brother.</p>
<p>Zhuge Suran looked at the battlefield and called Zhuge Sang.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Zhuge Sang opened his eyes sharply.
 He spoke first before Zhuge Suran even spoke.</p>
<p>There are a few of them.</p>
<p>Sweat dropped from the forehead of Zhuge Sang.</p>
<p>Its difficult to check exactly because it is a dog fight but…there are about a hundred to a hundred and fifty people less on the side of the Death Faction.</p>
<p>Zhuge Sang turned around slowly and checked his back.
 The direction he was looking at was towards the tent at Weng An.</p>
<p>Uncle, it seems like we fell in a trap.
 There are about a hundred to a hundred and fifty troops less.</p>
<p>Hahaha, what are you saying? It seems like you made a misunderstanding because it hasnt been long since you entered the battlefield.
 Moreover, look at the front.
 The River of Death isnt able to fight back at all and are dying!
Zhuge Sang turned gloomy.</p>
<p>Zhuge Sak and the Weng An warriors were already drunk on victory and couldnt see anything.
 They threw themselves at the soaring morale and yelled towards the martial artists of the Death Faction.</p>

<p>Calm Down (2) .<br />
Kwajik! I reflexively opened my eyes at the sound of something breaking.<br />
Was it Blue? I was going to ask what she broke again, when I saw the table and remembered that I was in Yoohyun’s house.<br />
The 9 o’clock news was coming out of the TV.<br />
…9 o’clock? That Yoohyun stubbornly insisted that he wasn’t sleepy when we got to his house, but he fell asleep in the end? I should’ve set an alarm instead of just sleeping because it was annoying to.<br />
I quickly raised my body, but I saw Yoohyun sitting on a sofa.<br />
He wasn’t sleeping.  </p>
<p>Hey, why didn’t you-!The words, ‘wake me up’, couldn’t leave my mouth.<br />
The two eyes looking at me were extremely cold.<br />
I heard Peace faintly growling on my lap.<br />
I saw a cell phone that seemed shattered in Yoohyun’s hand.  </p>
<p>Is your hand ok, no of course it’s okay.<br />
First of all, I held Peace and soothed him.<br />
I couldn’t feel it very well, but that guy seemed to be in quite a vicious state.<br />
Though I didn’t know the reason.<br />
……Actually, there were so many reasons why he could be angry so I wasn’t sure.<br />
Hey.<br />
I have no intention of hearing it from hyung.<br />
Speaking concisely, Yoohyun stood up from his seat.<br />
He threw the cell phone onto the table, and opened a cabinet on one side of the living room.<br />
Unlike him, maybe he didn’t adjust his strength very well, because the cabinet handle broke.<br />
Inside, I saw cell phone boxes that didn’t even have their wrappings opened.  </p>
<p>What is all that.<br />
Since they break easily.<br />
He answered, but his voice completely wasn’t normal.<br />
It seemed like he was thinking of just switching the SIM card, but would the card still be okay? Just then, there was another breaking noise.<br />
Tuk The box and cell phone that were shattered together fell to Yoohyun’s feet.  </p>
<p>……Hey.<br />
com for a better experience.<br />
The wrapping didn’t come off easily.<br />
And then the second cell phone was also also crushed.<br />
I heard a small sigh.<br />
He wasn’t being like that on purpose.<br />
When I thought like that, I was suddenly worried.  </p>
<p>Yoohyun.<br />
Just a minute.<br />
Since before, his voice was even.<br />
The third cell phone was safely taken out.<br />
But SIM card pin was stuck in a weird place.<br />
The hand that had picked up the pin seemed like it was slightly trembling, too.<br />
Staring down at the cracked phone, he grinded his teeth.  </p>
<p>……Should I do it for you.<br />
No.<br />
And the last cell phone broke.<br />
A silence descended heavily.<br />
Han Yoohyun glared at the shattered cell phone in his hand like he would pierce through it.<br />
While not moving an inch, like a doll whose springs had completely unwound.  </p>
<p>Yoohyun, Han Yoohyun.<br />
com for the best novel reading experience.<br />
……His reactions really was weird.<br />
I lowered Peace onto the sofa and stood up from my seat.<br />
Yoohyun didn’t move at all until I was one step from his side.  </p>
<p>Even if you have no intention of listening to me, listen anyways.<br />
First, I wasn’t planning on hiding it.<br />
It’s obvious that it’d be exposed immediately anyways, so why would I hide it? I just forgot for a moment.<br />
I only thought of you and Peace since I heard that you two came out.<br />
I actually had completely forgotten.<br />
If I had remembered, I would have prepared an excuse and explained first, before this trouble occurred.  </p>
<p>……You forgot.<br />
That’s right.<br />
I don’t know what you heard, but it wasn’t anything much.<br />
Yoohyun’s eyes went towards me with difficulty.<br />
They were hardened eyes that seemed angry, but they also seemed very faintly frightened.  </p>
<p>How is it not anything much? The reason I was able to be unworried was because I thought there was no reason for hyung’s life to be threatened.<br />
Since at the least, high rank Hunters would think of your usefulness and keep you alive at least.<br />
So it really was the Noah matter.<br />
com for the best novel reading experience.<br />
He didn’t attack me.<br />
…He didn’t.<br />
That’s right.<br />
He wanted to go at somebody else, not me.<br />
Though it was a problem that he was regarding me as that other person, as Riette.<br />
Yoohyun spit out a short breath and placed the broken cellphone in the cabinet.  </p>
<p>Who was it.<br />
Did you break your cell phone without hearing all of it? Noah Luire.<br />
He’s not from Korea, and apparently he’s the overseas Ark Guild’s guild leader.<br />
It seemed like he didn’t know.<br />
He frowned slightly and asked me again.  </p>
<p>Are you sure? You didn’t hear anything else that was weird.<br />
…Like he fell into a cultist religion, something like that.<br />
Why suddenly a cultist religion? He wouldn’t be talking about a normal cult, so was he talking about the side that saw the dungeon system as a god? No, it should still be before they grew their influence?.<br />
I don’t know what that is, but it wasn’t that at all.<br />
It was just something like a sibling dispute.<br />
I was unluckily dragged in, and Yerim protected me, so I didn’t get hurt that much.<br />
And I definitely got treated.<br />
See here.<br />
Now there wasn’t a trace of it.<br />
In the first place, it wasn’t a severe injury either.<br />
Yerim got a lot more hurt.  </p>
<p>Anyways, what’s the cultist religion? Weren’t you on guard against other guilds or Hunter related people.<br />
I don’t know specifically either.<br />
…Something like Confucianism.<br />
I mean, that’s not a cult.<br />
Confucius would lament.<br />
Besides that, was there something to become serious over because of Confucianism? If you just looked at Yoohyun’s reaction, it would’ve seemed like some SSS-Rank monster had burst out.<br />
I thought I should interrogate him more in detail and was about to open my mouth, when Yoohyun made the first move.<br />
com for a better experience.<br />
So did that Noah guy die.<br />
…He was physically okay and was just imprisoned.<br />
He didn’t run away, but he’s still fine?Yoohyun tilted his head doubtfully.  </p>
<p>He was obediently taken away, and there were no deaths nor any damage to Unawakened People.<br />
Yoohyun, don’t you think of touching him either.<br />
Once you know, he’s a pitiful person.<br />
Did the Seseong Guild Leader go into a dungeon again.<br />
No.<br />
He came with a healer.<br />
But nothing much happened? Does he have a connection with that guy?…If you leave someone alone, does that mean you have a connection? How farfetched.<br />
He did say he would subdue him.<br />
Though I refused.<br />
Anyways, it was a mistake, and he’s quiet now, so leave him alone.<br />
I’ll see.<br />
But what about the finger marks on your neck?…Did he hear about that too? At any rate, Yoohyun knew that I had fear resistance, so it was easy to explain.<br />
When I conveyed what Song Taewon told me, his expression showed that he felt bad but that he understood.  </p>
<p>So I was going to leave the fear resistance off at home at least.<br />
Though with the circumstances, I’ll be meeting with high rank Hunters a lot, so it’ll be better to leave it on normally.<br />
…Try turning it off once.<br />
Right now?It wasn’t something I couldn’t do.<br />
I nodded my head and turned off the Fear Resistance skill.<br />
There wasn’t an immediate difference.<br />
It was just to the point of feeling Yoohyun’s and Peace’s presences a little stronger.<br />
Could you say it was the difference between a cat and a wildcat? Yoohyun, who stared straight at me as if looking for my response, smiled slightly with his eyes.  </p>
<p>It doesn’t seem like anything changed.<br />
Obviously.<br />
And I’m adding this just in case, but there really wasn’t anything in the hospital room.<br />
The Dokkaebi just pulled a prank.<br />
Even Chirpie was there, but not even a single piece of fluff got hurt.<br />
I confessed first and held Peace, who was hanging around my feet.<br />
In the meantime, the time had gotten close to ten.<br />
Blue must be asleep already.  </p>
<p>I have to go home now, but is there anything else you want to ask.<br />
I’ll take you there.<br />
And then he held out his hand toward me.  </p>
<p>What.<br />
Key.<br />
He demanded like it was obvious.<br />
I put one of the two remaining entrance keys in the held out hand.<br />
It was the building right next door, so we could just walk over.<br />
There was Yoohyun as well as Peace, but I didn’t need to worry over safety.<br />
com for a better experience With the fear resistance turned off, I felt a slight intimidation from the A-Rank Hunters we met on the way.<br />
It was unbalanced to be afraid of A-Ranks with an S-Rank next to me, but it was like that even before the regression.<br />
Rather than Yoohyun, I was more reluctant to face Kim Sunghan and Suk Simyeong and thought them scarier.<br />
Was it because I had seen him since he was young? The SIM card was okay and there happened to be a cell phone store on the other side, so after Yoohyun bought a new cell phone, we followed along the road.<br />
The night air was kind of cool, so it felt nice.  </p>
<p>It’s been a while, something like this.<br />
Normally walking down a road without anything else happening.<br />
It must’ve been a while for Yoohyun too, but it had been a really, incredibly long time for me.<br />
Maybe because we were close to Haeyeon Guild, there weren’t any people approaching, surprisingly, so I thought even more of past times.  </p>
<p>If the world was the way it was, it wouldn’t have been a long time.<br />
Why did it become like this? I didn’t ask the system administrators that.<br />
Even if I had, I didn’t think I would get a proper answer back.  </p>
<p>Does hyung like there not being any dungeons better.<br />
Of course.<br />
Above all, it’s dangerous.<br />
People who have good skills or stats usually feel the opposite.<br />
Unless they were harmed directly.<br />
com for a better experience Then again, that was so.<br />
If I had become about A-Rank from the start, I might’ve thought my life was set.<br />
Though now, A-Ranks or S-Ranks or whatever were unpleasant.<br />
It was already quite tiring, and I worried what would happen from now on.<br />
Would it really end well as long as I gathered 50 like the system people told me, and it was suspicious too.<br />
…Would the future suddenly becoming completely dark, also be an effect of turning off the fear resistance? It felt like the worries I had pushed to the back of my mind where rushing forward at once.  </p>
<p>Did something special come out through the dungeon rewards?I quickly changed the subject.<br />
Only just the two of them, and if you excluded Peace, then him alone, got through an S-Rank dungeon, so the rewards should be better than usual.<br />
Did something like a title come out? At my questions, Yoohyun briefly hesitated and took something out of his inventory.  </p>
<p>Something I saw for the first time came out, but I don’t know what it’s for.<br />
What that guy was holding in his hand was a small red egg.  </p>
<p>It’s an SSS-Rank item that only has the name ‘Red Egg’.<br />
That’s…I had seen it before.<br />
Before the regression.<br />
An unidentifiable egg series that very occasionally appeared.<br />
Red, blue, green, etc.<br />
– about five of them had appeared, but they were items that nothing was revealed about.<br />
They were tough so they didn’t break, and whatever you did, there wasn’t any reaction, so they were judged to be useless.  </p>
<p>Who knows, I’m not sure at all either.<br />
Give it here for a second.<br />
I took the egg and tried using the My Brat skill just in case.<br />
But the notification window that it didn’t have the keyword applied didn’t pop up at all.<br />
As expected, it didn’t work.<br />
Even if the growth skill worked, it was impossible to apply the keyword to an egg that didn’t have ears.<br />
Then, I tried using the Seed-Leaf skill too, but nothing appeared this time as well.  </p>
<p>It doesn’t seem like a normal monster egg either.<br />
Is it really just an item?If it was alive, the Seed-Leaf skill could be used, but there was no reaction.  </p>
<p>Just in case, should we give it to Myeongwoo? It could be used as material.<br />
Do whatever you want.<br />
com I was going to put the egg in the inventory, but Peace showed interest.<br />
When I put it right in front of his nose, he quickly bit it and gnawed on it with his teeth.<br />
Even so, not a single scratch appeared.<br />
It was an egg that was immune even when S-Rank Hunters 5 years later, who had much more outstanding abilities than now, used all their moves.  </p>
<p>Don’t drop it.<br />
-Geureung Even if it was the building right next door, the rearing facility was large and you had to go around the front building, so it took a fairly long time.<br />
I worried about Chirpie, who wouldn’t have fallen asleep yet, and Comet, who would soon wake up, but my pace was relaxed, unlike my mind.<br />
While we were chatting about this and that, we arrived at the front of the rearing facility before I knew it.<br />
What should I do; should I tell him to sleep over before he goes? But Comet was a problem.<br />
Should I ask the rearing facility to take care of it for just today? It seemed like one day was okay.<br />
Just then, my phone rang.<br />
When I took it out, there was a text from Song Taewon.<br />
[Noah Luire has disappeared again.<br />
I would like to ask you to check again please.<br />
com My spine went chilly.<br />
I turned my head to the side.<br />
When our eyes met, Yoohyun smiled.<br />
First, I turned the fear resistance skill on again.<br />
When I became calm, I smiled back as if there wasn’t anything wrong.  </p>
<p>Yoohyun.<br />
Can’t we go back to Haeyeon Guild.<br />
Hm? Suddenly why.<br />
I just want to rest a lot for about a day.<br />
I thought about how I’ll have to look after the kids again if I go in now, and became tired.<br />
At my words, that little brother had a doubtful expression.  </p>
<p>There’s the rearing room.<br />
And Hunters in charge, too.<br />
Didn’t you leave them to them and come out anyways.<br />
That’s true, but…Shit, what should I do? If we went in like this and met with Noah, I couldn’t know what would happen.<br />
Since there was no certainty that Yoohyun would quietly just greet him and let it go, or if Noah would see me and think of his noona again.<br />
……To think it had to meet crises where it would get broken, my poor house.<br />
Let’s quickly go in.<br />
Wait, wait a moment-.<br />
Yoohyun opened the entrance’s glass door.<br />
He went a few steps forward, not listening to me trying to stop him, when he suddenly stopped.<br />
He cocked his head a little slowly.  </p>
<p>There’s an unfamiliar trace.<br />
My fri…end, or not that, but it’s the younger brother of someone I know.<br />
You know somebody who has an S-Rank Hunter as a younger brother? There aren’t any in my memories.<br />
We’ve recently become close, through social media.<br />
We got a little close and now we had fallen out.<br />
…Did I have to tell him about Riette, too? There were a lot of people who heard the contents of the call, so it was wrong to hide it.<br />
Why was there so much happening in just a few days?.<br />
But why is he here? And it’s the middle of the night.<br />
He came to visit, related to the monster rearing, but, um, should I say it’s showing some sincerity……How do I even explain this? While I was organizing what to say, Yoohyun started to walk again.  </p>

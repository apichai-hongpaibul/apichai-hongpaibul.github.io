<p>Chapter 141: A Shard Within (3) Of course, Hyunjae Sung did not say that he will trust me.<br />
He responded with a gaze filled with suspicion and curiosity about what my plan was.  </p>
<p>I have a psychological skill that I want to use to return your memory.<br />
However, since my stats are low, I cannot use it without your consent.<br />
You’re telling me to accept a psychological skill.<br />
Yes.<br />
Hyunjae Sung’s expression was expectably sour since who would like to have his or her head dug up? A hunter with violent tendencies might start swinging a sword to open up my head first.  </p>
<p>How soft was I on you for you to say that kind of nonsense without hesitation.<br />
I’m trying to help you out of goodwill with some risks on my part.<br />
I’m quite expensive, Sesung Guild Leader.<br />
Even for me.<br />
Not if you gave me the Sesung Guild.<br />
Give up.<br />
You’re confident.<br />
Stop avoiding the subject.<br />
I cut into the chase.  </p>
<p>If you don’t like my proposal, go on living like now.<br />
I needed some things from him, including immediate cooperation, but the Hyunjae Sung in front of me did not know that.<br />
So, I went in strong.<br />
Hyunjae Sung’s eyes narrowed at my provocation, and I felt chills run down my spine.<br />
The house was cold enough for me to have goosebumps on my arm.<br />
I should make an appeal that he has to keep me alive about now.  </p>
<p>Please calm down and look at this.<br />
I pushed my phone to him that displayed an article about me.<br />
It included details about the farm facilities, riding beasts, and Myungwoo.<br />
Hyunjae Sung picked up the phone and scrolled down the article without speaking.  </p>
<p>This is the Comet Soyoung was talking about.<br />
It’s a cute dragon with useful skills that have not been revealed yet, like my skill of doubling the effect on offensive skills.<br />
That’s not very useful for a low-grade hunter.<br />
com for a better experience.<br />
This skill can be shared.<br />
I told you that we hunted a SS class monster together, right? It was quite effective there.<br />
Then why did I leave you alone?Hyunjae Sung tilted his neck as he returned my phone.  </p>
<p>I would have tamed and tied you up.<br />
I have an L class curse resistance skill, so that might be difficult.<br />
An L class?His pale eyes looked surprised.<br />
A Hyunjae Sung, who does not know anything about me, was amusing in his responses.  </p>
<p>I also have high-class poison resistance.<br />
I nullified your contract with that lizard.<br />
Check if you want.<br />
I wondered when you spoke about an arm and a leg.<br />
I lent you a hand.<br />
I have nothing to lose if I go back and will live well in peace.<br />
You, however, need me.<br />
You’re aggressive for someone who does not have a problem.<br />
It’s for the times we had, so I’ll say this one last time.<br />
I raised one hand and continued.  </p>
<p>Please submit to my skill.<br />
He was not someone who would give up in front of an F class when he had so much to know.<br />
Hyunjae Sung nodded his head after a short while.  </p>
<p>It’s been a long time since my last gambit.<br />
I heard that less than a month ago.<br />
Please don’t get addicted.<br />
Hyunjae Sung let down his suspicions at my words and smiled.<br />
com for the best novel reading experience *** I had Irin’s help the last time I used this skill, so this was my first time using it alone.<br />
I was worried about whether it would work properly, but from my struggle to turn off the skill last time, I made a psychological space more easily than I thought.<br />
I opened my eyes to see a room where the light came in from a large window.<br />
A man was standing with his back to it, and his eyes smiled as he saw me.  </p>
<p>Hello, Yoojin Han.<br />
How can you be so calm greeting me?My worry sank and grew cold.<br />
I had been a tiny bit worried, but it was a meaningless emotion.<br />
Maybe I should just get out.  </p>
<p>I apologize for surprising you since this was beyond my estimations.<br />
I was not surprised, but I was almost killed.<br />
I see that I had been impolite.<br />
It was nothing.<br />
I was dragged by a chain and went up the stairs with my body, and almost drowned in an aquarium.<br />
I’m ashamed of my actions.<br />
You came to my home, and I only served water.<br />
Do you call that serving? I did drink a lot though.  </p>
<p>So, what happened? Can you get out again.<br />
I began to feel that something was wrong from about two months ago.<br />
Hyunjae Sung slanted his neck and started speaking.<br />
Two months meant that he had felt the effects of my regression.  </p>
<p>At first I sensed minor differences, but I remembered something concrete at dawn that my abilities to handle magnetic forces in range and intensity were still weak.<br />
Deep golden eyes looked at me.<br />
Taewon Song did not know that Hyunjae Sung could use magnetism, and it was because he was unable to wield it.<br />
‘His range and intensity were powerful.<br />
com If he could use magnetism that well, he had to have used it on a smaller scale a few times beforehand.<br />
Controlling properties perfectly like that was impossible despite it being a property innate in a hunter.  </p>
<p>I also vaguely remembered things I forgot, but they scattered like sand.<br />
I tried to go after them, and that’s why I’m in this situation.  </p>

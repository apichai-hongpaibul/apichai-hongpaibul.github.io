<p>Shaanxi, Mount Hua. “Don’t forgive me!” Gu Pung bowed his head so low, it almost touched the ground. “Senior brother…” Yu Jong Mok had a troubled expression. Even if the both of them were third generation disciples, Gu Pung was the best of their generation. Receiving an apology like this would only make Yu Jong Mok troubled. “I couldn’t fulfill my responsibilities as the guardian of the Lotus Peak. Because of you, your disciple got sacrificed…i’m really sorry.” Gu Pung’s voice was filled with guilt. He wasn’t even able to raise his head properly. About three weeks ago, he won against Yook Dae Rang miraculously and survived but he wasn’t able to save Ju Seo Cheon. He reported it to Mount Hua and patrolled for a few days with the warriors of the Murim Association but they couldn’t find him. They wanted to look for them for a little bit longer but an urgent order to return was sent so he had to take the members of the Lotus Peak and return to Mount Hua. He had continued searching without stopping but he wasn’t able to get a clue and returned not long ago. In reality, it was no different from having come to a conclusion that he was dead. “It’s all my fault. If I had believed in your disciple even a little, things wouldn’t have turned like this.” In addition, Ju Seo Cheon’s evaluation was completely overturned. There was no one that called him the flashy yet frail one anymore. Everyone was surprised by Ju Seo Cheon’s performance.
They got amazed at his attitude of not minding the disdain from his surroundings at all working hard on learning more, all the while hiding his strength and skills. That’s why it was all the more regrettable.
They couldn’t stop lamenting having lost that kind of genius. – Yu Jong Mong had been in Kang Ho for a long time since he became a pinnacle expert. But one day, he heard news about Ju Seo Cheon and returned hurriedly to Mount Hua, and that day was today.
Gu Pung, that was staying in Mount Hua, heard notices about Yu Jong Mok returning and went to find him first to bow.
“I would like to go to the Nine Fleets of the Water Forest and get revenge but…”
He wasn’t able to move because of his situation.
Even the Murim Alliance was investigating this matter.
There was no way Yook Dae Rang would suddenly ambush the members of the Lotus Peak and the direct descendants of the Zhuge Family if he hadn’t turned insane.
On top of that, based on the information they had it was said that the ships were regulated on purpose in case the group crossed the Yangtze River in small groups. They were doubting that there may be something behind it as it was a systematic ambush.
“Even though I don’t have a disciple, that doesn’t mean that I don’t know what sadness, rage and pain that comes when losing a disciple means. It doesn’t matter for me so please, resent and despise me.”
The masters were like parents for their disciples, and that meant that the disciples were like children for the masters.
Although they shared no blood at all, they were connected by love and a connection that was beyond that.
“I won’t ever….” Yu Jong Mok wasn’t listening silently since before. He had tried to calm him down but Gu Pung only repeated similar words and continued to apologize. It seemed like he was yelling him to kill him.
“Senior brother.”
In the end, Yu Jong Mok had to interrupt Gu Pung inevitably.
“Yes.”
Gu Pung put on a determined face.
But the words that came out from Yu Jong Mok were complety different to what he was waiting.
“I’m fine so don’t be like that.”
“Fellow brother.” “Acting like that is harder for me.”
Yu Jong Mok smiled bitterly and his eyes seemed somewhat complicated.
“It hasn’t been long since I returned to Mount Hua from Kang Ho. It seems like my body and mind are a bit tired that I need some time alone. I guess that’s why I could feel all those gazes on me.”
“….I’m sorry. I wasn’t thinking straight.”
Gu Pung apologized once again with a dark expression. Yu Jong Mok couldn’t even remember how many times he had apologized.
“So can you leave me alone for the moment?”
“Right, I understand. I’m really sorry for not having been considerate. Have some rest.”
Gu Pung left. His two shoulders were weighing with guilt.
Yu Jong Mok confirmed that Gu Pung had left and let out a sigh. “Seo Cheon, you were much more amazing than what this master of yours thought.”
He raised his right hand and checked his bosom. A folded letter came out from it.
Yu Jong Mok received a letter when rumors about his disciple spread and it reached the branch of the Murim Association he was at. The disciple, that was known to be dead, was the sender.
The contents written in the letter was too long. But if you were to summarize it was that he was safe but was asking his master to keep it a secret.
That he was sorry to have made him worry and that he would certainly return with Zhuge Seung Kye.
“I’m worried about you so don’t be too late.”
Yu Jong Mok raised his head and looked at the sky. It was a clear weather with no clouds at all. Weng An, the Golden Business Organization. Lee Ui Chae ended up buying a house in Weng An as he mostly active there.
The prices of the houses in Weng An were so cheap it made you doubt about it but it wasn’t weird at all if you thought about the characteristics of Weng An.
People that looked like martial artists were gathered in front of the courtyard. There were ten of them and Ju Seo Cheon had checked them when he entered.
Nine were second rate and only one of them was first rate, that was close to reach the peak.
“It’s fine if their abilities aren’t that good. The most important thing is trust. It doesn’t matter about the treasury because it will get known later but the group has to be composed by people that won’t escape with the treasures.”
“You don’t have to worry if it’s that.”
Lee Ui Chae put on a reliable smile. “You aren’t going to say something like they are reliable because they are your blood relatives, right? If that is the case, then I will have to decline. This is a world where even siblings kill each other for treasures.”
“I’m not such a naive person, great master.”
Lee Ui Chae spoke telling him not to worry.
“The people that are outside are all people that treasure their own families. Also, there’s a person each in their families that they have to support.”
“You didn’t take their families as hostages, right?”
Zhuge Seung Kye frowned and asked.
“Oh my, young noble Zhuge. I’m not such an evil person.”
Lee Ui Chae shook his hands. “I made a deal with them. That if they were loyal to me, I would treat and heal their families for free.”
There are times when people did anything for their treasured people and Lee Ui Chae used that love.
“I only searched for people that won’t be able to hold a few days without my assistance. Also, I also investigated about their character beforehand. Shouldn’t we also consider a situation where they escape with their families after they obtain some treasures? Hohoho!”
‘What should I call this?’
Ju Seo Cheon got astounded. It wasn’t a threat but if you thought about it well, it was no different from a threat.
It was a situation where you could think of it like ‘I may kill your family if you betray me.’
But it was also vague to say that he was evil
In the first place, they were unrelated to each other. Lee Ui Chae had no sense of duty to take care of their families by spending a lot of money for it.
Lee Ui Chae had only offered a deal, not a threat and the ones that accepted were themselves. ‘His ability on dealing with people is ghostlike, just like the rumors said.’
Being outstanding in business meant that he was also good at negotiating.
The Merchant King noticed the intentions of the people like a ghost and knew exactly what they wanted.
And he utilized that to get the most of the profit.
The subjects for that didn’t differentiate between forces such as the Righteous Faction, Demonic Faction, Death Sect or the Blood Sect.
It wasn’t for show that he stayed alive until the age of war ended.
‘That’s why he is also a scary person.’
Lee Ui Chae understood the emotions of the people better than anyone else. He had to understand them to use that as a means to earn money. There were no emotions in his understanding. There was no disdain, scorn, rage or sympathy at all.
He was simply using them as a means to earn money.
“I already told the warriors that they would be raiding a tomb.”
“How did you introduce me to them?”
“I said that you were an expert whose words had to be followed with no complaints. They are people that don’t know your face or young noble’s Zhuge so you don’t have to worry about that.”
“Well done. The treasury is in Chongqing. The exact location is here, so sent people to a nearby village. We need means to contact you quickly when we return.” Ju Seo Cheon handed out a coded map.
“And this is a decodification method. Memorize it all and burn it down.”
“Ohh, as expected of the great master! Knowledge that can even slap on the honor of Zhuge Liang! You are really omniscient!”
Lee Ui Chae got impressed in an exaggerated manner and hit his forehead with his palm.
“Kya! This small merchant got so impressed that tears are about to fall.”
“Cry then.”
“Men shouldn’t shed tears easily.”
Lee Ui Chae handed out a pocket that contained travel expenses. “I will be assisting your trip from a side and from somewhere they can’t see me. Raid up to the heart of the treasury. But of course, you know that treasures are more important than bones right?”
“Head merchant, wipe your drool first.”
“Hut! I made a mistake. Let’s meet again later, then. I hope you have a safe trip.”
Ju Seo Cheon took Zhuge Seung Kye and the ten warriors Lee Ui Chae gave him and left to Chongqing.
Chongqing was filled with martial artists of the Righteous Faction to search for Ju Seo Cheon and Zhuge Seung Kye but that wasn’t the case now.
They couldn’t even see any pirates. It was because the Eighteen Strongholds of the Monsoon Rain had given out an order to be prudent on plundering for the moment. “They want us to believe in that kid that has just started to grow pubic hair?”
The warriors got dumbfounded when they first saw Ju Seo Cheon, before their expedition began.
It was because the expert the head merchant had introduced was a youth that had just come of age.
In the Midlands, one became an adult at fifteen years old. That meant that he wasn’t even a youth.
If they had known that Ju Seo Cheon was actually only twelve, they may have convulsed.
“Sh, shout your mouths. It seems like he really is an expert.”
The only first rate warrior among the ten of them raised his index finger and placed it on his lips. He was telling them to shut up.
Experts recognized low ranks but contrary to that, low ranks couldn’t recognize an expert.
“Is that true brother Wang?” Brother Wang was the first rate warrior, Wang il.
The name Wang il was a old fashioned but he was still a first rate warrior that almost reached the peak. He was someone that had grown up to that boundary from the pit so he was that respected and also had many people following him.
“Is he really a martial artist?”
Normal people didn’t learn martial arts and that’s why there was no rank.
It was obvious for them to not recognize it.
“You must have also seen clearly the steps of captain Ju or his posture with no openings.”
“Mm.”
“Don’t look away because of your pride. And even if he is not an expert, we must obey his orders. Didn’t the head merchant say so before leaving Weng An?”
“I’m sorry brother Wang.”

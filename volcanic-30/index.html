<h1 id="vocanic-age-chapter-30">Vocanic Age Chapter 30</h1>
<p>Editor: Imagine
Lee ui Chae couldnt contain his surprise when he heard the words that came out of Ju Seo Cheons words.</p>
<p>Dear God, the Treasury of the Three Eyed Immoral God!
It wasnt too much to say that he was doubting his ears.
 The Water Spirit Fruit I consumed a few years ago wasnt discovered in an underwater cave but in this treasury.
 Ju Seo Cheon lied on purpose.
 It was to make Lee Ui Chae believe in him a little bit more.</p>
<p>The concept of the treasury itself was so absurd he had to dress it up in lies.</p>
<p>What will you do? Mmm.</p>
<p>Lee Ui Chae stayed silent.
 It seemed like he was thinking how he should receive this news.</p>
<p>â€˜His eyes dont seem like theyre lyingâ€¦
Those were eyes that didnt shake at all and had a strong conviction.</p>
<p>They were so upright and clean it sucked you in.</p>
<p>He didnt think for long.
 Lee Ui Chae put down his belief for a moment and spoke out the doubt that popped up in his head.</p>
<p>Leaving aside the existence of the treasury, how are you planning to move that many treasures secretly? That is realistically impossible.</p>
<p>The number of treasures lying dormant in the treasure wasnt low at all.
 They had to mobilize a lot of people for it.</p>
<p>Thats why it would inevitably get exposed.</p>
<p>And the biggest problem was the people they would have to mobilize.</p>
<p>People were weak in front of treasures.
 They may change their attitudes and turn into robbers.</p>
<p>If that was the case, they would have to find people that wouldnt hit them in the back but that wasnt something easy to do.</p>
<p>Mobilizing disciples of Mount Hua was the most certain thing but if that happened, nothing much would return to Lee Ui Chae.</p>
<p>No, in the first place it was doubtful whether they would let him in.</p>
<p>Its realistically impossible to get all the treasures with only our strength.
 I dont know if its you but the treasures would certainly fly away at the hand of robbers if the treasures are in the hand of a small merchant like me.
 Theres no need to take all of it.
 And by that you meanâ€¦? Its fine even if its a little as its better to find people that can be trusted.
 Then, I will enter the treasury with those people and only take the most valuable things.
 It will be enough even if we share that.</p>
<p>Indeed.</p>
<p>Originally he had also planned to mobilize the most they could.</p>
<p>He hadnt been looking for the merchant king for nothing.</p>
<p>It was because he thought that he would already be a merchant with some standing.</p>
<p>But his circumstances werent as good as he thought.
 He didnt think that Lee Ui Chae would have nothing.</p>
<p>He had set up a plan to mobilize about a hundred to two hundred people but he was wrong.</p>
<p>Thats why he modified his plans as soon as he saw him.</p>
<p>To give up on quantity and aim for quality.</p>
<p>The small merchant in front of him, no, the merchant king, was as valuable as the treasury.
 And what the merchant king was lacking right now was capital.</p>
<p>He would be able to perform well alone if only he had the funds.
 It would be much more valuable if he made Lee Ui Chae indebted with a debt that couldnt be paid.</p>
<p>The merchant king went crazy with money but he was also the most reliable person in business.</p>
<p>If you keep shut about this proposal and you accept, I will make it so that your Golden Merchant Business is able to take care of the provisions of Weng An.
 I understand.
 But great master.
 If the treasury really exists, why are you entrusting it to me? Suspicion and confusion appeared in Lee Ui Chaes eyes.
 Ju Seo Cheon laughed out loud.</p>
<p>Look, merchant I dont have anything.
 If I were to ask help from a more renowned merchant, tell me, would they trust a child?
There is not much time.
 I will probably be leaving tomorrow or after two days.
 The time the Lotus Peak members would be in Kang Ho wasnt long and they had already accumulated enough experience so there was no reason to stay back.</p>
<p>I will do it.
 Lee Ui Chae didnt think for long.</p>
<p>If Ju Seo Cheons words were true, then this was a big opportunity.
 On top of that even if it wasnt the treasury, just lending him the rights to trade the provisions for Weng An was enough for him.</p>
<p>Above all, his instincts were yelling at him not to give up on this opportunity.
 His nose had been paralyzed long ago due to the smell of money.
 His body heated up as if he was drunk.</p>
<p>Then, let me tell you about the details.
 The smile in Ju Seo Cheons face became denser.</p>
<p>Ju Seo Cheon told a part of his plans about the treasury to Lee Ui Chae.</p>
<p>It didnt matter if the merchant king believed in him or not.</p>
<p>He would listen to a request if profits were promised to him.</p>
<p>After he separated with Lee Ui Chae, he returned to the branch in Kae An immediately and sent a letter he had prepared beforehand through a carrier pigeon.</p>
<p>The receiver was Jang Tak.
 That was the name of the second rate warrior that fought with him in Weng An.</p>
<p>Jang Taks position in Weng An was higher than he thought.
 He was the right hand of the branch manager that participated in the battle of Kae An.</p>
<p>And he had heard before leaving that he would become a sub branch manager because of the merits he accumulated this time.</p>
<p>If it was Jang Tak, that was undoubted to him, he wouldnt just listen to his request but would try his best to fulfill it and there were several others that were indebted to Ju Seo Cheon so he didnt need to worry about it.</p>
<p>There was a separate thing he should worry about.</p>
<p>We are going to return to Mount Hua tomorrow so get ready.
 The feast ended and the order to return to Mount Hua sect had already been given.</p>
<p>It was now time to return.</p>
<p>He couldnt stay in this place anymore.</p>
<p>Jang Hong and Jang Seo Eun felt regret.
 The freedom they tasted after having lived as a fourth generation disciple under strict rules was really sweet.</p>
<p>The freedom it gave was that much charming even though it was life threatening.</p>
<p>We wont go to the Shaolin Faction, the Shaman Faction, or the other branches of the Murim Association in Anhui? Jang Seo Eun pulled on the sleeves of Gu Pung and looked up at him.
 It was a cuteness all men would fall for.</p>
<p>â€˜You are doing well! Keep doing that!
Ju Seo Cheon cheered Jang Seo Eun inwardly.</p>
<p>But his cheers were for naught.
 Gu Pung put on a troubled expression and shook his head with strict eyes.</p>
<p>I also want to show you more things but unfortunately that will be a bit heart.
 I dont think my heart will be able to endure it.
 Ah, please senior uncle~ Hang Jong also acted cute but it didnt work.</p>
<p>Coming to Kang Ho is originally meant to accumulate experience, its not as dangerous as this.
 What happened this time was an exception.
 Fortunately, you didnt get hurt but the main office is also worried about you and already said that it would be for the best to return.
 So we cant do anything even if its regretful.
 The expedition to Kang Ho had ended.
 They werent able to do anything about it and had to return.</p>
<p>â€˜They say that worldly affairs dont go as plannedâ€¦
Originally he had been planning to receive the help of Lee Ui Chae when he was about to return to Mount Hua and slip away to go raid the treasury.
 I needed time but that got drastically reduced.</p>
<p>A fortune among misfortunes was that the Zhuge Sega also received the order to return and that they would be able to stay together until the Midlands, where the treasury was located.</p>
<p>He needed the help of Zhuge Seung Kye to disarm the mechanisms of the treasury.</p>
<p>But the problem was what came after that.</p>
<p>â€˜Ive set up the trade but I cant ask the merchant king to follow us.
 Even if we go to the Midlands and somehow raid the treasury, we have to return to Guizhou.
 But how?
Mount Hua would certainly intervene if he told Gu Pung about the treasury and it would be the worst if Zhuge Sang heard him.</p>
<p>No, in the first place there was no way they would believe in the existence of the treasury.</p>
<p>Even if he took Zhuge Seung Kye, it was going to be hard to evade the eyes and senses of a pinnacle expert like Gu Pung.</p>
<p>In the end Ju Seo Cheon was sent off by several people before he could finish his thoughts and left Guizhou.</p>
<p>The time it took to return wasnt long.
 They received horses that were as good as named horses when they left Kaiyan.</p>
<p>Horse riding skills were also taught in the Lotus Peak.
 It wasnt an institution of geniuses for nothing.</p>
<p>The reason they didnt ride on a horse since Mount Hua was to train in their foot techniques, not because they didnt know how to ride a horse.</p>
<p>The Zhuge Sega also showed excellent riding skills.
 Even them, that seemed to have no reflexes, rode on horses quite well.</p>
<p>It was because the martial arts and the internal energy of the household itself was low and the Light Step Arts, that consumed a lot of internal energy, didnt suit them.</p>
<p>Several horses left dust clouds behind their trails while riding.
 There were eighteen horses.</p>
<p>Four for Mount Hua, another four for the Zhuge Sega and ten warriors of Kaiyan that Shin Do Gyun sent as escorts.</p>
<p>The group didnt stop except for sleeping, eating, or when they were really exhausted and continued riding and thanks to that they were able to arrive at Guizhou early.</p>
<p>Some group of bandits appeared but they fled immediately when they saw the group that didnt seem normal even at first glance.</p>
<p>For Ju Seo Cheon, this situation really drove him crazy.</p>
<p>Gu Pungs eyes were bothersome but there were watchmen in the name of guards.
 His insides burned down.</p>
<p>The River of Death.</p>
<p>Sect lord, we received news that the Fourteenth Gallant Sword is going to arrive at Yangtze river soon.
 A commander of the River of Death, Ak Gwan Tae, read the report.</p>
<p>Is he here? The lord opened his eyes, they resembled that of a beast.
 He released killing intent that had displeasure and rage mixed in.</p>
<p>My anger doesnt get eased up even after decapitating the fools that attacked Weng An but escaped.
 They are trying to return safe and sane? The matter in Kae An wasnt that big.
 Battles in that region occurred as frequently as having meals.</p>
<p>If it was serious, the owner of that territory changed about ten times in a day.
 It wasnt something to be that angry as was an everyday occurrence.</p>
<p>I wouldnt be this angry if we had lost like usual.</p>
<p>Defeat wasnt that important.
 That happened so frequently that they just let it slide and prepared for the next attack.</p>
<p>But the problem was that it was a â€˜complete defeat.</p>
<p>The sect lord wasnt the one to prepare it directly but the sect had prepared quite a bit for the battle.</p>
<p>The commander Ak Gwan Tae intervened a little bit in examining the decoy tactic and approved it.</p>
<p>They had expected the Fourteenth Gallant Sword to lead the remaining forces and enter the battle in Kaiyan.</p>
<p>But the problem was that they werent able to conquer the empty house in Weng An.
 If they had succeeded in it, they would have secured hostages to deal big damages.
 But that didnt turn out that way and got defeated completely.</p>
<p>The result of that birthed his humiliation and rage.</p>
<p>Ju Seo Cheons actions ended up changing the future.</p>
<p>It was a future that wouldnt have occurred originally.
 Weng An got conquered and they had to retreat from Kaiyan because of the hostages.
 But a changed future would also change another part of the future.</p>
<p>Teach those brats of Mount Hua a lesson.
 The eyes of the sect lord shone slyly.</p>
<p>Yangtze, at the harbor.</p>
<p>Hm? Gu Pung tilted his head.</p>
<p>Whats the matter Fourteenth Gallant Sword? Zhuge Sak saw Gu Pung act like that and looked at him strangely.</p>
<p>Ah, its nothing much.
 I was just wondering why there arent many ships.
 Zhuge Sak checked his surroundings at Gu Pungs words.</p>
<p>There were certainly not many ships and there were no small boats at all.</p>
<p>It is indeed weird.
 At this time of the year, tourists that come to enjoy the view of the Yangtze are overflowing.
 And it wont matter much because we have many people, right? Haha.
 Zhuge Sak touched his beard and laughed.</p>
<p>The group didnt ride on a skiff but on a middle sized ship that could easily accommodate fifty people.</p>
<p>They could ride in two separate skiffs but then, it became meaningless to have brought warriors to guard them.</p>
<p>In addition, it wasnt that they had no money so there was no reason to put up with that discomfort.</p></div>

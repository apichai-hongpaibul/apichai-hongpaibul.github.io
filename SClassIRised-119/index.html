<p>&lt; Superior Rank Bait (2) .<br />
The audience ratings should shoot up.<br />
In the middle of the world’s sole magic beast trainer’s interview, the Haeyeon Guild Leader had appeared and was showing a rare look, when a proclamation of arrest fell.<br />
And it was on a live broadcast, at that.<br />
If I could also see this sight on TV, I would’ve really liked it.<br />
Unfortunately, it was my situation, so I couldn’t make any popcorn.<br />
Geez, my life.<br />
Bemoaning to myself, I turned off the fear resistance skill.<br />
At the same time, Song Taewon’s gaze toward me felt scary.  </p>
<p>S-suddenly, talking about arrest…?I stood up from my seat, being very taken aback.<br />
Peace, who jumped down from my lap, cried ‘kkioong’ softly.<br />
Blue, who didn’t understand the situation, tilted her head.  </p>
<p>Excuse me, I am…Song Taewon took out handcuffs that had an inventory sealing function.<br />
It had been a while.<br />
It was the first time after the regression, too.<br />
I had thought that I would live a life far from something like this, but to think that my first experience was on a live broadcast – ah, my life.  </p>
<p>com for a better experience Yoohyun blocked in front of me and said coldly.<br />
It was realistic acting.  </p>
<p>If you did not hear, then once again-.<br />
I very clearly heard that groundless nonsense.<br />
You are putting quite an impressive false charge on a stat F-Rank Hunter who has not even been Awakened for two months.<br />
If we are certain of his innocence, we will immediately send him back.<br />
Please stand aside.<br />
As the two’s fight of spirits slowly became stronger, my body trembled a little.<br />
It was good that I didn’t need to act.  </p>
<p>Yoohyun, calm down.<br />
Maybe I, did something wrong.<br />
Hyung.<br />
I’m not sure what it is, but don’t be like this because of me.<br />
You’re a guild leader.<br />
I stood forward, with a frightened expression.<br />
Was the camera filming it well? It was something I couldn’t do twice, if at least because it was embarrassing, so I should firmly embed this image with this chance.<br />
Even if he was an S-Rank Hunter, he was this normally human.<br />
com Yoohyun grabbed me from going toward Song Taewon.<br />
I thought it was enough if it was this much, though.<br />
As I mumbled in my head and turned around to look, my heart skipped a beat.<br />
His expression acting was a little excessive.  </p>
<p>Hey… it’s okay.<br />
I’ll be released soon.<br />
Can’t you just not go? I’ll do something somehow.<br />
I mean, Yoohyun.<br />
We agreed that you’ll show a law-abiding appearance even if you wavered.  </p>
<p>I don’t want to cause trouble for you.<br />
…Sorry.<br />
Saying I was sorry, my gaze fell to my feet.<br />
Maybe because I had turned off the fear resistance, my insides were really uncomfortable.<br />
This time, Peace came over towards me as I was shaking off my brother’s hand.<br />
-Kkeuooong Like he had already practiced, he let out a mournful noise.<br />
Our Peace was quite smart.<br />
I bent my knees and pet Peace.  </p>
<p>You’re good, right, Peace? Dad will come back quickly, so quietly wait for me.<br />
com -Kkioong.<br />
Blue, don’t make trouble either.<br />
-Kkyaoo? It was gesture saying she didn’t know what was going on.<br />
The picture in contrast to Peace was perfect.<br />
Considering I was just going to be confined for a short while, it was an exaggerated farewell scene, but there was a need to show some melodrama in order for the future.<br />
After soothing Peace, I turned back to Song Taewon.<br />
As soon as the handcuffs were fastened on my wrists, other characters appeared again.  </p>
<p>Yoojin.<br />
Yoojin-ssi!Myeongwoo and Noah came rushing over with expressions asking what this was out of the blue.<br />
I had said those two didn’t need to put themselves forward as well, but they were stubborn about seeing me off when I was getting taken away, so they were added in.  </p>
<p>It will be stifling because it is the basement, and there are no windows…Noah, who had experienced the detention center before, had a worried face, saying that even the humidity was cold maybe because it was summer.<br />
At those words, Myeongwoo was startled, asking if there weren’t even dehumidifiers.<br />
The facility was on the better side, but it was a detention facility, so of course there weren’t.  </p>
<p>I’ll go visit straight away.<br />
I will go as well.<br />
But really, why put handcuffs? Isn’t it too much with even an S-Rank coming to get you?Myeongwoo said, glaring at Song Taewon.<br />
All of them acted really well.<br />
…It was acting, right?.<br />
It’ll be okay.<br />
Thanks for worrying.<br />
Thank you to Noah-ssi, as well.<br />
Let us go now.<br />
Song Taewon grabbed my arm.<br />
Hyung!-Kkeuang!.<br />
Yoojin.<br />
Yoojin-ssi!…That was enough.<br />
Anyone seeing this would think I was going off to die.<br />
They also followed after me being dragged away by Song Taewon.<br />
The camera furtively followed, too, as if it couldn’t miss out.<br />
The parking lot was near the building, so there was a considerable amount of people staring throughout the way there, so it was embarrassing.<br />
It was hard keeping up a frightened face.<br />
I should’ve covered myself with outer wear, too.<br />
The car was thankfully not the small car, but a special police car.<br />
It was a vehicle that was made a little more durably for Hunter use.<br />
Even so, it could be easily broken by even a mid rank combat Hunter.<br />
I went into the car in the midst of gazes overflowing with pity.<br />
It had to resolve well the way I thought it would.<br />
*** It was a strange scene.<br />
com The young man standing in the falling rain was a normal human.<br />
An ordinary person who could easily be squashed down like wet mud if he was lightly pressed down on.<br />
But monsters[1 that would be hard for Song Taewon to handle were standing guard on both sides of him.<br />
While having soft eyes like tamed dogs.<br />
At first, it was surprising.<br />
And he was apprehensive.<br />
Wondering if those things had put a leash on an good-to-use stat F-Rank and were acting tolerant as if treating him like a pet.<br />
But that ordinary person, that harmless looking young man between those monsters, wasn’t normal.<br />
Han Yoojin’s gaze had obvious affection.<br />
He adored and loved the monsters loitering around his side, and those two eyes even had presumptuous worry.<br />
Very normally.<br />
As if he was facing normal people.  </p>
<p>…I understand.<br />
I will try to announce it as fast as possible.<br />
Song Taewon ended the call as he let out a short sigh.<br />
The aftermath of the live broadcast was huge.<br />
Stat F-Rank.<br />
The appearance of a person no different from an ordinary person being caught by an S-Rank Hunter while being frightened, would’ve been incredibly stimulating.<br />
On top of that, his family and animals, as well as friends, had rallied around him.<br />
‘Though there wasn’t a young child.<br />
com If even Bak Yerim had been there, it would’ve shaken public opinion one level more.<br />
Even now, complaints were piling up.<br />
Song Taewon slowly rubbed his chin.<br />
A person that monsters embraced and were satisfied with as if he was their own child.<br />
It was still a little hard to grasp how to treat that.<br />
He let out a sigh again and walked.<br />
*** ‘I can’t get an injury.<br />
’ It was obvious but handcuffs were uncomfortable things to have on.<br />
Maybe because they were for Hunters, they were pretty heavy.<br />
I moved my wrists on the table here and there in vain.<br />
At the words that I would neatly play bait in order to expose the Association’s rotten roots, that little brother naturally was opposed.<br />
In order to persuade him, I even had to write a contract and several memorandums.<br />
‘I agreed to quietly stay in place without a complaint after this if I get an injury where blood comes out.<br />
’ Myeongwoo and Noah also inserted themselves and took one copy each.<br />
What started off with ‘it’ll be safe, I won’t get hurt’ at first, developed into some kind of body waiver in the end.<br />
com If I happened to get wounded, it would be just that if I secretly treated it with a potion, but it would be best if I didn’t have to see blood.<br />
If it was exposed, the number of body waivers that would be pushed toward me were as much as three.<br />
If Yerim had been there, it would’ve been four.<br />
Creak Along with the sound of the heavy iron door opening, Song Taewon came into the interrogation room.<br />
He had on the stiff face that he always had whenever I saw him.<br />
As an S-Rank, he was good looking, so he would look much softer if only he had even a hint of a smile.<br />
Was that face better for work?.<br />
You have a handgun.<br />
It is for against Unawakened People.<br />
A short reply came back.<br />
To think it was a firearm, for someone for whom it would be enough to just pick up a pebble and throw it.<br />
And it wasn’t like he couldn’t adjust his strength.  </p>
<p>First, I will assert that I am innocent.<br />
This is not being recorded here, correct.<br />
There is no audio or video recording.<br />
Was the black dragon Hunter Riette.<br />
It was a passing monster.<br />
The matters regarding Hunter Han Yoohyun were clearly wrong, but this was excessive.<br />
What could be done about it collapsing due to bad luck? It should be built again.<br />
About half is from taxes.<br />
I became sorry in an instant.<br />
Taxes, so it was taxes, huh.<br />
Then again, it made sense.  </p>
<p>…I am B-Rank, so I pay taxes as is.<br />
A lot of work from overseas will also come in from now on, and I will probably pay a lot.<br />
Haeyeon said they would handle taxes for me, but I was just going to sincerely pay them.<br />
I was satisfied as long as I earned enough to live comfortably during my life.<br />
Even if I had a lot of money, there wasn’t really anything I would use it for.<br />
I will become a sincere payer of large taxes, so please overlook it.<br />
A short silence flowed.<br />
Sitting on the opposite side, Song Taewon opened his mouth with an expression that made it hard to know his inner thoughts.  </p>
<p>It is not that I have decided to cooperate yet.<br />
I can send Han Yoojin-ssi like this.<br />
In order for me to play bait, I had to get free of the close-to-perfect protection.<br />
I could do something stupid like just wandering around alone, but that was too much like yelling that it was a trap.<br />
If they had brains, they would realize it was suspicious.<br />
com So the method I choose was confinement.<br />
The Association had their hands deep in the Hunter-use detention center.<br />
And if Song Taewon left, only mid and low rank Hunters would remain.<br />
That meant it was an environment where it wouldn’t be hard to secret away one person.<br />
On top of that, imprisoned Hunters carried out escapes frequently, so it was easy to make an excuse if I disappeared.<br />
And a reasonable charge could be made from me making Noah make Hunters faint a few days ago and the false report about a gate.  </p>
<p>You should not be like that after coming this far.<br />
But if I was imprisoned, Song Taewon would protect me, at least because of my importance, so I needed his cooperation.<br />
He had to leave his position, so that I could be kidnapped.  </p>
<p>Isn’t it helping to expose the rotten parts of the Association.<br />
I did not agree to go so far as to raise the Haeyeon Guild Leader’s reputation and aggravate the distrust related to the Association.<br />
If Han Yoojin-ssi disappears in this situation, the backlash will be big.<br />
As it is after purposely being on broadcast, you probably do not have any intention of hiding the disappearance.<br />
Song Taewon said coldly.<br />
Well, it was true I tried to wring out something extra.  </p>
<p>I am offering my one body, so I should receive that much compensation.<br />
If the Association was clean in the first place, this matter would not have happened, isn’t it so? It is reaping what you sow.<br />
Wasn’t fixing the Haeyeon Guild Leader’s image enough with the broadcast? Please hide the disappearance.<br />
You are defending them excessively.<br />
Song Taewon-ssi.<br />
Are you not already well aware that the Association is pulling nonsense? Just speaking of the Awakening Center, they tried to open it without countermeasures.<br />
Even so, do you have the heart to take their side? If you have the title of public servant, you should think of the citizens before the Association.<br />
It was a matter that hadn’t happened yet, but even if you just counted the Awakening Center case, the Association was trashy enough.<br />
In the first place, it was a problem starting from the expertise-less head.<br />
It wasn’t like this from the beginning.<br />
Making the shopping mall, which was a market for official items, and providing the groundwork for the Hunter registry was commendable.<br />
They had also planned out a system for dungeon bidding and management.<br />
But they were trying to get settled in, so they pushed out the staff right away.<br />
It hadn’t even been half a year since the current head got the position.  </p>
<p>Is it the citizens?The ends of Song Taewon’s mouth twisted slightly.  </p>
<p>If the Association loses strength, the S-Rank Hunters will start to run wild first.<br />
Han Yoojin-ssi.<br />
Are you not wishing for that as well? While mistakenly believing that you are in an equal position to those guys.<br />
It was heavily weighted, but it was a sharp voice.<br />
If the fear resistance hadn’t blocked it, I would’ve felt a considerable pressure.  </p>
<p>You have misunderstood me quite a lot.<br />
com Though if the cumbersome Association disappeared, it would be easy for the kids to play.  </p>
<p>If the Association was in a good state, then I think it would be okay for it to exist.<br />
I am speaking of an Association with proper staff on top.<br />
Like Song Taewon-ssi.<br />
The gaze toward me became seeped in a higher level of coldness.<br />
Should I use Eunhye or not? It seemed okay for now.  </p>
<p>You mean simply due to the reason of being an S-Rank Hunter.<br />
Not simpl-.<br />
Deureureuk The chair I was sitting on was pushed back.<br />
It was because Song Taewon’s hand had grabbed my collar and pulled me.<br />
I blinked while having been dragged about halfway on top of the table.<br />
It was in an instant.  </p>
<p>What is it that you want.<br />
com The glint in his eyes seemed like he would choke my neck if I said nonsense one more time.  </p>
<p>I have many things I want, but they are things that cannot be attained.<br />
Exactly how great of a greed do you have that you cannot attain them even with your position.<br />
It is small, though.<br />
Please speak.<br />
There are various things, but what I want recently is Yoohyun going to school normally.<br />
Making friends and dating.<br />
Sometimes he would drink too much and return home late.<br />
He hasn’t done drunken antics even once before.<br />
The day when I would go ‘why did you drink so much’ and slap his back probably wouldn’t ever come.<br />
Song Taewon’s expression, which had been chilly throughout the entire time, crumbled slightly.  </p>
<p>It is not much, really.<br />
But who would grant this?”Advertisements The world would have to change again, so would they have to be something like a god? I really didn’t have much that I wished for.<br />
I only wished for things that would all naturally occur if you just lived diligently.<br />
I smiled toward the face imbued with confusion.  </p>
<p>Song Taewon-ssi.<br />
Folding your body into a small car and taking the subway and carrying a handgun, do not matter in the end.<br />
What I also wish, is for things to be the same as they were in the past.<br />
But things that will not happen, do not happen.<br />
Strength disappeared from the hand that was grabbing my collar.<br />
I sat down again in my seat and smoothed my collar.<br />
It was clear that Song Taewon was wrapped up in the pre-Awakening past.<br />
How should I say it – he seemed like a tiger who believed he was a cat.<br />
One that was sitting blankly, with only one foot inside a paper box that he could comfortably fit in when he was a baby.<br />
‘How do I drag that out?’ I wasn’t in a position to speak.<br />
Even now after regressing to live a new life on top of suffering for several years, I was an idiot who couldn’t throw away lingering feelings.<br />
Still, I was more or less conforming to the change and moving.<br />
Did Song Taewon also have to regress once to change?.<br />
……I will cooperate at least.<br />
com for the best novel reading experience.<br />
Ah, then please go on a date or something at night.<br />
I will get kidnapped during that time.<br />
And I will take responsibility for the disappearance.<br />
Leaving my post even while knowing of Han Yoojin-ssi’s importance and past kidnapping case, is a significant blunder and act of negligence.<br />
……This person, really.  </p>
<p>Do you want to be criticized that much? It seems like you are already being criticized a lot.<br />
Song Taewon didn’t reply.<br />
But his expression didn’t have a single indication that he was reluctant about the future where he would take a heavy responsibility and be dragged down as he was denounced.<br />
Somehow, wasn’t it something welcomed instead? So this person was pretty warped too, huh.<br />
I had that kind of thought.<br />
The situation was set up, but it wasn’t like news would come right away.<br />
I worried about what to do if my detention center life lengthened, but thankfully, the client I was waiting for came to find me the next evening.  </p>

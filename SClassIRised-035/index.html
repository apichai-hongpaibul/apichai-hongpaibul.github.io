    <h1 id="the-s-classes-that-i-raised-3">The S-Classes That I Raised 3.</h1>
<p>&lt; Repetitive Work Specialization .<br />
I was frozen for a short while, and then I urgently went to the next page of the skill window.<br />
[(Standby)(Standby)(Standby)(Standby)(Standby)(Standby)(Standby)(Standby)(Standby)(Standby)(Standby)(Standby)(Standby)(Standby)(Standby)(Standby)(Standby)(Standby)(Standby)(Standby)(Yoo Myeongwoo-F)(Kim Sunghan-A)(Peace-C) Skill growth targets – Bak Yerim, Yoo Myeongwoo ……Peace? Wait, really our Peace? Even though a window about being influenced never came up? ‘Explain a little.<br />
Please explain a little.<br />
Give an explanation.<br />
If you just give a detailed usage instruction manual, really, no matter what I have to do, I’ll fill it with S-Ranks like you want, so please kindly explain a little.<br />
’ But a thick usage instruction manual didn’t descend from the sky with light and the background music of trumpets.<br />
This crappy system.<br />
Let’s just think it over calmly and in earnest.<br />
If it wasn’t a system error.<br />
The title was Perfect Caregiver, the skill’s name was My Brat is the Best, and the keyword to influence was ‘I love you’.<br />
com Until now, I had thought that the keyword was something that was applied in one blow after paying a lot of lip service.<br />
But if I were really a proper caregiver, it was only right to consistently express my love towards my brats.<br />
Not just once.<br />
‘…Could it be that, me continuously telling Peace that I loved him was the proper way to use it, something like that?’ There was no way for me to know which way was the right one.<br />
But thinking of the caregiver title, it seemed like steadily heaping affection and influencing them was the answer.<br />
At any rate, the end justifies the means[1.<br />
‘Still, with this, it’s definitely possible to raise monsters now.<br />
’ I was worrying about what I should do if the keyword happened to not be applied to Peace, but I was relieved of a big worry.<br />
And I could probably substitute the system’s crazy demand with monsters.<br />
Of course, filling it with 50 S-Rank monsters wasn’t an easy task either.<br />
First, I had to have them to raise them.<br />
It was extremely rare for S-Rank dungeons’ middle bosses or boss monsters to come with a baby.<br />
And since I had to capture them alive, the level of difficulty in obtaining them was atrocious.<br />
‘Even if people caught one with good luck, if they confirm that it is impossible to grow, then they probably would kill it.<br />
Even up to 5 years from now, there were barely any cases of raising monsters to adulthood.<br />
com for a better experience It wasn’t that there weren’t any at all.<br />
In those cases, it probably was that the conditions happened to be met.<br />
They were all low rank monsters, so it was highly likely that the growth conditions were easy.<br />
‘Unless some guy pops up suddenly out of nowhere with a monster-rearing special skill, probably only I would be able to raise high rank familiars[2.<br />
’ I should try to negotiate with the giant guilds with this.<br />
If you would guarantee my safety, I will impartially raise one at a time.<br />
Of course, I would receive the reward separately.<br />
It would be better that way than being monopolized by one place, so mediating wouldn’t be difficult.<br />
Then Yoohyun would definitely be able to worry less.<br />
Of course there would probably be a lot of salivating bastards going ‘come~ there’s a little F-Rank with a money-making skill rolling around’, but I wouldn’t need to concern myself with the small fries.<br />
I would just need to be a little careful until I got my exclusive use magic beasts.<br />
Would they go so far as to go into the Haeyeon Guild building and try to kidnap me? Thanks to Peace, I arrived at the guild in a good mood.<br />
First of all, there were a total of 48 standby slots.<br />
No matter what kind of crazy guy who made the system was, they wouldn’t expect me to fill them in a few days.<br />
In the first place, why did I have to do it? I refuse until you tell me the reason, it’s a strike.  </p>
<p>Hey, Yoojin.<br />
com I was about to quickly go up and give Peace a kiss or something, when Yoo Myeongwoo started talking to me with a face like he was going to die and a voice that was dying away.<br />
Why was this guy like this again?.<br />
The first dungeon was pretty brutal, right? This was a special case, so don’t worry, and let’s hurry up and return the equipment and go up to rest.<br />
You had to rest well today and start the physical labor tomorrow.<br />
And sell the magic stones to buy bladed tools.<br />
Instead of new ones, would older ones be better? Should I search a junk shop?.<br />
No, I’m… definitely not a guy who can do this I think.<br />
Said the guy who would get an SS-Rank skill after suffering for a little bit.<br />
It was something that would make the entire country’s millions of FF-Ranks throw rocks.  </p>
<p>In the end, I didn’t even get… a skill with 10 levels….<br />
There’s really nothing to worry about.<br />
They said cases when they appear late are common.<br />
Hey, I didn’t get a skill with 10 levels either.<br />
Huh? You too.<br />
That’s right.<br />
My level went up when Yoohyun was catching the bird bastard.<br />
But I didn’t get anything.<br />
com Even with the consolation that we were both in the same boat, Myeongwoo didn’t regain his energy, unlike normal.  </p>
<p>Still, you’re completely different from a guy like me.<br />
Your dongsaeng, he seemed really happy.<br />
If you’re someone who can give that kind of advice, something like your class[3 must be somehow good? You’re really special.<br />
His look when he said so was gloomy like he would crawl into a hole[4.<br />
It seemed like his state was a little more severe than normal.<br />
What should I do? Should I give him alcohol to drink?.<br />
First let’s go up and talk, go up.<br />
No, I think it’s only right for me to start to leave.<br />
They said there’s only theory left for the novice training too.<br />
I should probably be able to continue that at the Association.<br />
No, I don’t think there’s any need for me to take that either.<br />
I don’t really think I can do something like a dungeon attack.<br />
I’m sorry I made you waste time on someone like me.<br />
Still, I was really thankful.<br />
I won’t be able to forget you for the rest of my life.<br />
Yoo Myeongwoo mumbled like he was saying his will or something.<br />
It wasn’t a little, but a lot more severe.<br />
If I sent him away like this, it seemed, from his face, like he would try to commit suicide again.<br />
Was it because he was forced to interact with S-Ranks? It seemed like I was one of the causes too.<br />
Even if I said ‘actually you have the aptitude to get an SS-Rank production skill!’ he wouldn’t be convinced.<br />
It wasn’t something you could believe normally, so if I said it now it might have the opposite effect instead.<br />
And anyways, revealing the skill – Myeongwoo was a great guy but I didn’t have enough confidence in him to do that.<br />
Something that I hadn’t even told in detail to my younger brother.<br />
com for a better experience.<br />
If you think that way, then I can’t really do anything about it.<br />
I gave a big sigh and continued speaking.  </p>
<p>I don’t intend to force you to stay.<br />
It’s just… I got really good information, but now I don’t have a use for it so it’s a little regretful.<br />
I really did have a really good piece of information.<br />
An amazing one.  </p>
<p>…Information.<br />
Yeah.<br />
It’s information that would really help you a lot.<br />
But seeing how you’re having a hard time… I would feel sorry making you suffer more.<br />
It’s regretful, but if you don’t want to, I won’t force you.<br />
They say you can lead a horse to water but you can’t make it drink.<br />
[5Sighing deeply, I searched Yoo Myeongwoo’s gaze.  </p>
<p>Before you go, do you want to hear about it just once? It’s really precious information.<br />
So…I lowered my voice and said as if whispering.<br />
com for a better experience.<br />
You know Suk Hayan-ssi, right? The young lady who was in charge of the theory class a few days ago.<br />
She’s a genius who received a license to be a professor at that young age, and she’s pretty deep into studies about Awakened People.<br />
And her family is influential so she has a lot of all sorts of important information.<br />
R-really? That person.<br />
Yeah.<br />
Normally, I can’t tell others, but I got something specially.<br />
You can’t ever tell anyone that you heard this from someone, okay? Only you can know.<br />
Myeongwoo immediately nodded his head.<br />
Only to you specially, only you know.<br />
It was a magic phrase that hooked in people.  </p>
<p>You know weapon-related assistance skills.<br />
Like your Whetstone.<br />
Yeah… what about it.<br />
There’s a training drill to make Awakened People who have those kinds of skills get a really great, special skill.<br />
A training drill… to get a special skill.<br />
That’s right.<br />
Of course, it’s not easy.<br />
Still, if you diligently, quickly finish the drill, according to your luck, you could get a really great skill.<br />
I don’t really have much luck.<br />
What do you mean you don’t? Hey, just hearing about this is great luck.<br />
And it’s guaranteed to be at least a C-Rank.<br />
If you have a C-Rank assistance skill, you know there’s a~bsolutely no obstacle to living well, right?Saying SS-Rank would seem like too much of a scam, so around C-Rank seemed to be sufficient.  </p>
<p>……Really?The light returned to the eyes of Myeongwoo, who had seemed like a dead frozen pollack.<br />
Then, then.<br />
It’s real, right? Believe just in me.  </p>
<p>It’s just that it’s pretty hard.<br />
How hard is it.<br />
You know bladed tools, right? Like knives or scissors.<br />
You have to sharpen them.<br />
Exactly ten thousand of them.<br />
Yoo Myeongwoo’s mouth dropped open.<br />
com for a better experience.<br />
Te-ten thousand….<br />
Yeah.<br />
It’s definitely hard, right? I don’t want to see you suffer either.<br />
You just have to do ten thousand? Really?!Myeongwoo yelled as if cheering.<br />
The light in his eyes hadn’t just revived but was on fire.<br />
What, do you happen to like physical labor?.<br />
…That’s right.<br />
Though rather than ‘just’, it’s quite a lot.<br />
No, it’s not that much.<br />
If I sharpen a hundred each day, I’ll finish in exactly one hundred days.<br />
A hundred each…?In just a hundred days? To finish that fast, even if you said one took ten minutes, that was 6 in one hour and you had to work for seventeen hours, and eat and sleep in the remaining seven hours….<br />
……Do it slowly, slowly.<br />
com It was good to be passionate, but first you had to be alive to use the SS-Rank skill.  </p>
<p>Slowly? Should I do fifty each? But then it’ll take long… Troubling you[6 for that long is a bit….<br />
It’s okay.<br />
Your food is tasty.<br />
It was true.<br />
And as time went on, he became even more capable so it was to the extent of anticipation.<br />
Did he have any cooking related skills?.<br />
So, don’t worry.<br />
Instead of me, it would probably be harder on you? Shutting yourself in somewhere and only sharpening knives all day wouldn’t be easy.<br />
Don’t worry.<br />
There was a time when I was young when I was engrossed in making a model of the Battle of Hansan[7.<br />
I won a prize with it too.<br />
I have confidence in doing repetitive work all day in a house corner!Is that so.<br />
Was this nature also related to skill aptitude? It might be that he would roll out equipment like a factory after he gets Forge.  </p>
<p>Ah, I’ll take and put away the equipment.<br />
Yoojin, you go up first and rest.<br />
I was about to say it was okay but then I just gave him the equipment.<br />
If these little things were helpful, he would probably feel less burdened.<br />
com for a better experience Really, being too kindhearted was a problem.<br />
Then again, if he was someone who gobbled up anything given and didn’t know to be thankful, I would have thrown him away first.<br />
Since, if he betrayed me after getting the SS-Rank skill, it would be worse than not having one.<br />
And the keyword influence effect would be useless if there wasn’t a caregiver model.<br />
It was because Yoo Myeongwoo was a trustable character that I was able to grab onto him to this extent.  </p>
<p>Yoojin, seriously, thank you.<br />
I’ll work hard and pay it all back to you.<br />
Definitely.<br />
Myeongwoo said, before he turned.<br />
If you’re that thankful, just make me a good piece of equipment later or something.<br />
I figured out the matter of Myeongwoo and went towards the dorm floor with light footsteps.<br />
Now I really only needed to wait and then just take the harvest.<br />
Everything was mostly done, hooray.<br />
Time to play~ I’m going to slack off a lot~.<br />
The house was big and the days would get hot and I would turn the AC on full and roll around all day with Peace.<br />
I was going to stop caring about the weirdly changed status window and such.<br />
If you want to make me work, please descend[8 down directly, person who made the system.<br />
Definitely with the instruction manual.<br />
Cheerfully[9, I opened the door.<br />
The ‘click’ noise was so heartwarming.<br />
I should cursorily get through the remaining theory class and then become one with the sofa.<br />
Thanks to my dear dongsaeng-nim, I packed a ton of magic stones and wouldn’t have to worry about money.<br />
Should I buy some more stocks? Or should I pick out a car? Right, I should get my driver’s license first.<br />
com As soon as I entered, a bright light shone on the entrance.<br />
Across from the shoe rack, the smiling face of a man was reflected on the full-length mirror.<br />
I didn’t know who it was[10 but his expression looked quite good.<br />
It seems to be a face of one who would play and live well.<br />
But, behind him, there was another person wearing mourning clothe… Something clammy suddenly grabbed my ankle.<br />
Then, it pulled firmly.<br />
Ack, wait, that’s a foul-! Bam! I barely dodged to the side to avoid hitting my head against the steel frame of the inner door and fell.<br />
Fuck, Dokkaebi, this bastard, I told you to scare me, not to make an assassination attempt.<br />
I’m weak.<br />
Really weak.<br />
Don’t take an F-Rank’s weakness lightly.  </p>
<p>Ughhh, my hip… knee… arm…I only defended my head and hit everything else.<br />
It seemed like I would become one with the bed instead of the sofa.<br />
I didn’t think you would fall down that easily.<br />
…Apologize first.<br />
Sorry!A good child who listens well gets 1 point.<br />
When I tried to stand up, staggering, a hand stretched out from behind me and supported me.<br />
Ughh, my entire body was stiff.<br />
To think I would go around a dungeon unharmed and then get injured at my house entrance.<br />
Did I have luck or not? Did I have a pain relief patch at home? When I turned around, I saw the mask-wearing Dokkaebi crying.<br />
They wouldn’t have come here wearing it from the start, so did they put it on in the meantime? Looking at that unfunny appearance, I lost the intention to get mad too.  </p>
<p>You came later than I had thought?At my words, the Dokkaebi’s two shoulders drooped down.  </p>
<p>……I got scolded.<br />
You got scolded.<br />
I got scolded a lot! I got nagged at for two days for signing a contract as I please!”Advertisements Well.<br />
It seemed like Subordinates 1 and 2 were close to being guardians.<br />
Just how old were they? Since they didn’t say anything about the contract being invalid, they were probably at least over fully 14 years.<br />
Just looking at their height, they were an adult, but were they immature mentally?.<br />
Still, I talked big that it’d be okay because I could win! It wasn’t scary.<br />
Rather than being scary, I was about to go on the road to the underworld.<br />
Usually the moment when you get home is the most careless moment…The Dokkaebi said sullenly.<br />
I was certainly careless.<br />
Still, putting aside the resistance skill, even if I thought of it objectively, the time at the classroom seemed scarier.<br />
Was it because of Suk Hayan? The screaming had a big impact.<br />
Sound really was important.  </p>
<p>There’s still chances left, so hang in there.<br />
Of course, I had no intention of losing on purpose though.<br />
com for the best novel reading experience.<br />
Yeah! I’ll work hard.<br />
And go to a drugstore and buy a pain relief patch.<br />
P-pain relief patch.<br />
Quickly.<br />
Right now.<br />
One that works well.<br />
Saying ‘okay’, the Dokkaebi suddenly disappeared.<br />
It sure was comfortable.<br />
Did you hear, person who made the system? Teleportation for me too, please.<br />
[1 lit.<br />
sth like ‘even if you go sidewaysdiagonally, you just have to get to Seoul, that’s it’.<br />
It also means ‘no matter what path you take, you just have to get to your goal’, which I personally feel has a slightly different connotation than ‘the end justifies the means’ and suits this context better, but ‘the ends justifies the means’ is a lot smootherflows better… rolls off the tongue nicer?? [2 So I tried looking up 기승수 again and found nothing useful.<br />
All I’m (99%) certain about is that 수 definitely has to be ‘beast’.<br />
I’m also 90% sure that 기 is 技(talent, aptitude)伎(talent, skill).<br />
승 could be 承(connect, inherit??, support) or possibly even 乘(ride).<br />
Whatever it is, I’m keeping ‘familiar’ even if it ends up not exactly being a familiar bc at this point it seems to be a petcombat-support monster, and you can possibly stretch the definition of familiar to that I guess.<br />
It’s a made-up word so to tl, I’d have to use the exact word, make up a new word, or twist similar existing ones to fit it anyways, so… [3 he uses a word that means ‘rank, class, grade,’ that had been sometimes used interchangeably with the ‘rank’ in stuff like ‘s-rank’, but I didn’t think he was talking about that kind of rank bc then the sentence doesn’t make sense, but idkAdvertisements [4 lit.<br />
com [5 lit.<br />
‘if one doesn’t even want to be a pyeongyang mayor, then that’s that’ where pyeongyang (as in the current capital of n.<br />
k.<br />
) used to be a major city in joseon (what kr was called bf the war &amp; division) so being assigned as the officialmayor of there by the king was a rly good position but if u don’t want to do sth that’s good for you, then there’s nothing anybody can do abt it.<br />
[6 this is that ‘owe you’ phrase that you can use to mean to stay over at someone’s house, from ch.<br />
23 (see footnote [1), which I just realized has a similar eng equiv with ‘trouble you’ [7 it’s actually the ‘great victory [ofat hansan’ in krn but apparently it’s officially called this in eng.<br />
It’s a famous naval battle by a really famous admiral (Yi Sun-Shin) in krn history against the jpn.<br />
[8 this is a word that specifically means ‘a god comes down to the mortal world’ [9 lit.<br />
‘looloolala’ which is analogous to eng ‘lalala’ (as in like singing) and used to signal being cheerful or excited, but using it that way sounded weird in eng [10 he’s probably being… well not sarcastic, but funny, bc he’s talking about himself.<br />
This and the following sentence are in honorific speech to further highlight that.  </p>

<p>&lt; Irin (1) .<br />
‘Is there something like a side effect?’ Or was it simply that I had put myself forward too much, so my brother’s illness(?) relapsed? If it was the latter, then it was a relief… was it a relief? A side effect might be easier to resolve.<br />
Anyways.  </p>
<p>Don’t be like that, and let’s just sightsee or something and then go home.<br />
There’s still a lot to look at around here.<br />
It was a chance to go all out, hanging out while using someone else’s card.  </p>
<p>Yeah.<br />
After dealing with Sung Hyunjae.<br />
…Hey, if I become a missing person, I wouldn’t be able to do things like sightsee.<br />
Don’t worry.<br />
There’s the item that Hunter Yoo Myeongwoo made.<br />
Yoohyun took off the glasses and put it on me as he laughed.<br />
Uh… that was true.<br />
Even though the sacrifice of someone who would become my cover would be necessary.<br />
And, it might be okay to go missing here, and then live a little more relaxedly and comfortably.<br />
com I grabbed ahold my heart being captivated in an instant.<br />
Still, with how many things that have already been started, I couldn’t act ignorant.<br />
I couldn’t until I fully resolved the dungeons at least.<br />
And found the method to recover him.  </p>
<p>But you – your eyes I mean--Has it all been cleared up? Noah said, flying down toward here.<br />
At the same time, I felt Yoohyun trying to move.<br />
Hey, this asshole!.<br />
Noah-ssi!I urgently put the Teacher skill on Noah and sent Yoohyun’s sensations unilaterally.<br />
Along with hurried flapping, a flame cut through the air like an arrow.<br />
Taken aback, Noah turned his body and shot up to the sky.  </p>
<p>What are you doing.<br />
I was just going to intimidate him.<br />
com for the best novel reading experience.<br />
No, you shouldn’t intimidate people either!First, I tried to stop sharing the attack skill doubling.<br />
When I did, a message window popped up.<br />
[The other person has refused.<br />
…Damn.<br />
Maybe Yoohyun had also seen the message, because he quirked his lips up and smiled.  </p>
<p>Usually, it’s impossible to cancel this type of skill without the other person’s consent.<br />
Since you can hang something like a flight skill on someone and then cancel it in the air.<br />
The explaining voice was pointlessly gentle.<br />
I also knew that, but I didn’t know that it would be relevant to sharing a skill instead of directly putting it on someone.<br />
With Noah, it was lifted when I just let go of the hand I was holding, and with Sung Hyunjae… I fainted each time, huh.<br />
Wait, then did that mean that the skill sharing continued even after I lost consciousness during that time with the Babar? …Wow crap, it might have been really dangerous.<br />
Seeing how he quietly came out of the dungeon even so, more than I had thought, that person might be a better… a better… no, as expected, this wasn’t it.<br />
com -Chirp! The dragon who had gone one large circle in the air, turned toward here again.  </p>
<p>Please do not come over!My brother seems to be slightly not normal.<br />
Yoohyun spoke in a grouchy voice to me, who was looking at Noah worriedly.  </p>
<p>Lately I feel like you’re being stolen away, so I’m lonely.<br />
What do you mean ‘being stolen away’.<br />
I only have one younger sibling.<br />
There’s a lot of other people around who you’re close to.<br />
Even though I only have you.<br />
This sounded like a bit of a big problem.  </p>
<p>Hey, don’t be like that, and be friendly with Noah-ssi.<br />
Or there’s Kang Soyoung-ssi.<br />
Make friends, and also date someone.<br />
Even if you say there’s no helping it for Unawakened People or people with low ranks since there’s a barrier, there’s a lot of people with similar rank to you.<br />
com Emulate Yerim.  </p>
<p>You doesn’t know, hyung, so you’re speaking like that.<br />
Grumbling, he took out a thin sword from his inventory.<br />
It wasn’t what he usually used, but an A-Rank weapon.<br />
He threw it a bit away, toward the ground.<br />
Kwak.<br />
The sword pierced the ground, and again, various weapons like a great sword, dagger, scimitar, etc.<br />
pierced the ground while keeping a distance from each other.  </p>
<p>…What are you trying to do?The Teacher skill didn’t read the inside of someone’s mind.<br />
It was merely reading the movements of the body and mana ahead of time.<br />
With someone just taking out a fishing rod, you couldn’t tell if they were going to fish or hit somebody with it.  </p>
<p>The efficiency is bad, so it’s a skill that I don’t really use.<br />
Since it’s a little burdensome to use high rank weapons as 1 time use.<br />
It wouldn’t be a little.<br />
I don’t know what skill it is, but don’t use it.<br />
It’s a waste.<br />
And it’s better to resolve things with words.<br />
Are you going to keep on using the Teacher skill? It’s irritating.<br />
Do you have any intention of resolving things with words.<br />
No, not at all.<br />
Is it really painful if your skill is rejected.<br />
Yeah, a lot.<br />
Sorry, hyung.<br />
Hahaha.<br />
Smiling as I faced the red eyes, I withdrew the Teacher skill from Yoohyun.<br />
That little brother guy put on a satisfied expression.  </p>
<p>I’ll end it soon.<br />
Sung Hyunjae-ssi, please run away.<br />
It looks like stopping my brother is out of the question.<br />
Your life isn’t a loss, but your skill would be a waste.<br />
com Just then, the fire lizard passed the back of Yoohyun’s neck and moved to the other shoulder.<br />
The two eyes that were black, unlike usual, stared at me.<br />
The feeling that something really was wrong pierced me again, like a needle.  </p>
<p>Irin.<br />
At my call, the elemental blinked its eyes.<br />
Without much thought, half by habit, I used the Seed-Leaf skill.<br />
com The status window that had seemed like an item window when I had first seen it, had changed into something similar to an Awakened Person’s or monster’s.<br />
Besides that, to think it was an L-Rank initial skill.<br />
An elemental’s contract with contractor Han Yoohyun.<br />
There was no doubt that the skill was affecting Yoohyun.<br />
Something that was as much as L-Rank shouldn’t be a simple contract skill, and exactly what kind of effect did the skill have?.<br />
Lizard bastard, you come here.<br />
Hyung?Anyways, the lizard was the problem.<br />
I stretched out my hand and gripped Irin.<br />
The elemental that was grabbed, surprisingly obediently tilted its head.<br />
It couldn’t speak so I couldn’t interrogate it either.<br />
After wondering what to do about it, I used the Teacher skill.<br />
In an instant, I felt the illusion of my insides getting burning hot.<br />
The outward appearance was a small lizard that had climbed to the top of my palm, but the the sensations being conveyed over was a flame that didn’t have an end.<br />
It was a feeling like I had fallen inside a desert where bright red flames flickered instead of grains of sand.  </p>
<p>You……It really was no joke compared to what I had thought.<br />
Even while being a little taken aback, I focused the skill.<br />
Like when I had dug into the dragon human type at the lake dungeon.<br />
com And like that time.  </p>
<p>Huh?My vision briefly became dark, and then brightened.<br />
The place where I was standing was an unfamiliar… no, a familiar living room.<br />
The house that I had lived in before the dungeons had appeared, before Yoohyun had Awakened.<br />
[Hi! In that place’s living room, a round lizard whose size had gotten as big as a cat’s gave a greeting to me.  </p>
<p>…Irin?[Yeah, that’s right.<br />
Hyung, it is Irin! The fire elemental who replied perkily opened its mouth wide and laughed.<br />
com Bak Yerim lifted her head.<br />
The skill that had been applied to her disappeared.<br />
Terrifying Hatchling Class Teacher – vision sharing, like that skill’s owner could do, was impossible, but she could tell that Han Yoohyun had attacked to intimidate someone right before the skill disappeared.  </p>
<p>Did some other monster appear.<br />
Then he wouldn’t have tried to intimidate them.<br />
Sung Hyunjae said, moving his gaze past the building’s wreckage.<br />
Like he said, if it was a monster, there was no need to intimidate or whatever and he would’ve just directly incinerated it.<br />
Then exactly who did he try to intimidate? Bak Yerim quickly launched her body into the air.  </p>
<p>Ahjussi!She saw the devastated ground whose original form were hard to find after sweeping it away with water and then nicely mincing up the Kraken.<br />
And she saw Han Yoohyun as well, who was holding his hyung, who had lost consciousness.  </p>
<p>What happened?!A golden dragon quickly flew over and blocked Bak Yerim, who was taken aback and trying to go over to the two.<br />
com for the best novel reading experience -Please wait! -Chirp chirp!.<br />
Noah oppa? Chirpie?-The Haeyeon Guild Leader seems a little strange.<br />
…He also seems fine, but seeing how he is not listening well to Han Yoojin-ssi, he seems strange.<br />
-Chirp!.<br />
He is not listening to ahjussi? Then it is right that he is being strange!-And he said he would deal with the Seseong Guild Leader.  </p>
<p>That seems like he’s fine.<br />
-He also tried to intimidate me, but that is also not different from usual, so it is confusing.<br />
Ack, so he had attacked Noah oppa, huh.<br />
It is right that he is being strange! There is Chirpie and above all, it is right in front of ahjussi watching!Bak Yerim kept a good distance from Han Yoohyun as she went down.<br />
The two red eyes stared at her.<br />
It was a slightly irritated gaze without murderous intent, but Bak Yerim instinctively judged that she shouldn’t approach further.<br />
Instead, she asked Noah why Han Yoojin had fainted.<br />
-I do not know the reason.<br />
The Haeyeon Guild Leader also seemed taken aback.  </p>
<p>That’s a relief.<br />
It seems like he did not go weird enough to lay a hand on ahjussi.<br />
-He tried to reject the Teacher ski…….<br />
Wow, he really went weird.<br />
-He was thinking of shutting us up, but Yoojin-ssi could not even stop him, so I do not know when he will attack.<br />
Please be careful.  </p>
<p>com Bak Yerim adjusted her grip on the ice wood spear.<br />
Sung Hyunjae, who had come over at some point and was listening to the two’s conversation, slightly raised his brows.  </p>
<p>It’ll be difficult.<br />
Still, this side has three people.<br />
I will bind him down, so please smash the back of his head or something.<br />
At Bak Yerim’s confident words, Sung Hyunjae replied cool-headedly.  </p>
<p>The situation is not simple, little mistress.<br />
To deal with the Kraken, Han Yoohyun is in a state of having received the attack skill doubling.<br />
That’ll be maintained until Han Yoojin is separated from him.<br />
At the same time, it’s the same as him having an item that gives damage nullification and poison resistance.<br />
…That’s a scam.<br />
Bak Yerim thought of the Kraken that had burned up and disappeared in an instant.<br />
If she, who didn’t even have a decent flame resistance, was just grazed, wouldn’t she receive a serious injury? But she didn’t have even a fingernail’s worth of an intention to stand down.<br />
Rather, her will burned more as she stared toward the sea.  </p>
<p>com for the best novel reading experience Then Shadowless Day spread out toward Han Yoohyun.<br />
At nearly the same time as that, Hwareureuk- Flames appeared around Han Yoohyun like a round barrier.<br />
At the heat drying up even the moisture in the air, Bak Yerim clicked her tongue.  </p>
<p>Far from Shadow touching him, it can’t even get near him, so it’ll evaporate! I have confidence I can sweep away my guild leader, but could you help.<br />
If you ask me to stay out, I’d be sad instead.<br />
The red-black coat, the Sillekia’s Wings, landed down over the tailcoat.<br />
The long chains shook, and gold feathers were held between Sung Hyunjae’s fingers.<br />
Gold Gryphon’s Feathers.<br />
It was an item you could get when you hunted the S-Rank Gold Gryphon.  </p>
<p>It’s too bad about the Teacher skill.<br />
Try to catch the timing well on your own.<br />
For reference, gravel doesn’t burn well.<br />
Yes!Maybe she had understood, because her eyes sparkled.<br />
Sung Hyunjae ran unhesitatingly toward the domain wrapped in flames.<br />
Right before the heat that couldn’t be completely nullified even if he had an S-Rank flame resistance drew close, feathers shot out from the tips of his hands.<br />
com The gryphon’s feathers attracted wind.<br />
Hwiooong, along with the sound of the air roiling, the flames were strongly pushed to both sides as if curtains were yanked open.<br />
But the electric attack couldn’t touch its target and was carried away by the dagger stuck to the ground and ravaged only the surroundings.<br />
Dirt and rocks flew up, and right afterwards, the dagger exploded.<br />
The debris that should normally scatter in all directions, shot toward Sung Hyunjae like arrows.<br />
Kagagak- The wrapped chains blocked the debris, but even if you knew the direction they were shooting, it was impossible to handle all of them.<br />
Red lines were drawn on the back of Sung Hyunjae’s hand and the tip of his ear.<br />
There was one piece that was halfway pierced into his shoulder.<br />
A doubling skill effect had been added as well, to the attack that sacrificed A-Rank weapons.<br />
Normally, you would’ve become a hedgehog even if you were an S-Rank Hunter.<br />
Han Yoohyun took out a long sword in order to continue the attack.<br />
But.  </p>
<p>…When?His feet were heavy.<br />
They were caught in Shadowless Day.<br />
He had known that Bak Yerim had used Pale Rain as soon as Sung Hyunjae pushed away the flames with the gryphon feathers.<br />
But even without it directly touching the fire, he had melted all of it down while it was far from reaching his shadow .<br />
com for a better experience.<br />
Putting one or two pebbles inside ice arrows isn’t hard to do.<br />
Sung Hyunjae, who had drawn back and plucked out the fragments, explained kindly.<br />
Even if the ice melted, the gravel inside it didn’t lose its motility and went forward.<br />
It wasn’t a skill that designated a destination and it was simply throwing rocks, but one or two among those rocks could touch Han Yoohyun’s shadow.<br />
Even if it tied down the target’s movements down according to how high the target’s rank was, it was merely just slowing down the target’s speed.<br />
But even if it was just at that level, it was a big penalty for going against another S-Rank.  </p>
<p>I didn’t intend to move a lot anyways.<br />
Han Yoohyun said, looking down at his unconscious hyung.<br />
The flames that had been briefly pushed aside swallowed the gryphon’s feathers, and wavered bright red.<br />
The weapons that were stuck in all directions let out faint vibrating sounds.<br />
The eyes that were flushing red met the eyes that were faintly gold tinted.  </p>
<p>Since the preparation to rip apart the most irritating insect is done.<br />
”Advertisements.<br />
Oh dear, the young master’s jealousy is stronger than I’d thought.<br />
Why would I be jealous of a thief?He was just furious and was going to dispose of him.<br />
Just then.<br />
Geugeugeugeung- The ground shook.<br />
Then, along with the sound of the ground collapsing.<br />
Kwagwagwagwa-! Water started to shoot up here and there.<br />
The seawater that was piercing up through the surface of the earth squirmed like several dragons.<br />
Both Han Yoohyun and Sung Hyunjae unconsciously directed their gazes toward the water dragons that raised their heads toward the night sky.<br />
At the same time, Bak Yerim shouted.  </p>
<p>Han Yoohyun, cool your head!The giant column of water struck down toward the comparatively insignificant flames.  </p>

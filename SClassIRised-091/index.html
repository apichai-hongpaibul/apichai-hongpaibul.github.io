    <h1 id="the-s-classes-that-i-raised-9">The S-Classes That I Raised 9.</h1>
<p>Customized Kiseungsu(?) .<br />
I lifted the Teacher skill and looked around the surroundings.<br />
The floor that was caved in and split up as if a meteor or something had fallen.<br />
Like this, all my money would go into building repair fees.<br />
The small golden dragon was lying down hunched over, right where the wall was broken.<br />
The eyes darted around as if he didn’t know what to do.  </p>
<p>Blocking by even using your skill, aren’t you defending him too much?That Yoohyun came over and showed a face thick with displeasure.  </p>
<p>What defending.<br />
You are.<br />
That guy is the one who harmed you first.<br />
And hyung, didn’t you treasure Hunter Bak Yerim quite a lot.<br />
It’s because Yerim got hurt that I told you not to kill him.<br />
Not ‘don’t beat someone up’.<br />
At any rate, for me, I was reaping the consequences of my own fault.<br />
And whoever the other person is, there isn’t anybody who would welcome their family running wild, saying that they would kill somebody.<br />
Normally, they would be frightened.<br />
They would start off with saying ‘don’t fight with your bare fists’.<br />
It was so if you were an ordinary person.<br />
And even if you said I had Awakened, I was a stat F-Rank who hadn’t gotten much Mental stat compensation, and I had only gone around a dungeon while receiving protection like an ancestral tablet being enshrined.<br />
That meant that loathing it when someone said they would catch and kill somebody else right in front of me, was a normal response.<br />
At my words, a look of realization came across Yoohyun’s face.  </p>
<p>…Sorry.<br />
Even if you say it’s not scary, it doesn’t mean it’s okay.<br />
Hyung seemed so used to Hunters, so I forgot.<br />
Well, since I’m not like an Unawakened Person.<br />
And I acted in a way that made sense you forgot.<br />
If I thought about it, among the high rank Hunters, only Song Taewon had noticed that I was a little weird.<br />
Or specifically, should I say, the only person who noticed and cared for me.<br />
Sung Hyunjae didn’t seem like he wouldn’t know, but he probably wouldn’t care, and Moon Hyuna seemed like she would be like ‘if you don’t have fear, then isn’t that good’ and just pass over it.<br />
Yoohyun and Yerim were still too young to take care of things like that in detail.  </p>
<p>Anyways, I think this is enough.<br />
Isn’t it?He got burns as well as his wing ripped, and was hit a lot.<br />
Yoohyun was bitter, but he also nodded his head.<br />
com for the best novel reading experience.<br />
If I can be certain that he won’t try to harm hyung again.<br />
Today was the opposite of that.<br />
That’s also weird.<br />
Noah-ssi was like that because he thought of his noona when he saw you.<br />
Saying that he came at me because he thought of me as Riette without the keyword effect would truthfully make him seem like a crazy guy, so it was troublesome to explain.<br />
But, if you added my relationship with Yoohyun, it was explainable, in a way.<br />
I told him everything, about how Noah was originally an A-Rank Hunter, and how frightened he became just from listening to Riette’s voice.<br />
It was a bit much to lay out the painful inside story in front of the person directly involved, so it was with the translation item off.<br />
Noah also had a translation item, but maybe it had come off when he had transformed into a dragon, because he seemed like he didn’t understand.  </p>
<p>That’s why I think he must’ve seen me overlapped with himself at you saying ‘weak’.<br />
At any rate, being uneasy over ruining his noona’s request would’ve been a big cause, too.<br />
Coming at me at least is welcome, so it doesn’t matter.<br />
Yoohyun said, shrugging his shoulders.<br />
Was it something to welcome? He was like that in the dungeon too; were S-Ranks really that frustrated? If the ranking competitions didn’t quickly form, they might stir up trouble.<br />
Anyways, there was that kind of circumstances, and his age was similar to yours too, so I couldn’t help but be concerned.<br />
If you calculate it out, he’s an abused child.<br />
I won’t tell you to be good to him, but don’t provoke him like before.<br />
I put the translation item on again and turned to look at Noah.  </p>
<p>Noah-ssi.<br />
The head of the dragon lying down, moved a little and his eyes blinked.  </p>
<p>First of all, Yoohyun is different from Riette-ssi.<br />
He has not ever treated me poorly.<br />
-Geureureu He mumbled something, but I couldn’t understand it.  </p>
<p>Please try thinking of making words.<br />
As if you are using a skill.<br />
While your whole body was transformed into a beast, you couldn’t speak people words normally.<br />
Noah hesitated, and then made a sound again.<br />
com -I really am weak… It was completely dispirited voice.<br />
I wanted to go over and pet his head.  </p>
<p>Saying you are weak – you are not that at all.<br />
How is an S-Rank Hunter weak? Even just speaking of me, I am only stat F.<br />
Noah-ssi is stronger beyond comparison.<br />
As soon as I finished speaking, the round silver-gray eyes became wet.<br />
And then, sad tears began to roll and drop down.<br />
Ah, I mean, why was he crying? Did I say something wrong?.<br />
Noah-ssi?I thoughtlessly tried to go over but only just held back.<br />
I couldn’t be like this.<br />
-That is why I am weaker.<br />
Han Yoojin-ssi, is completely fine…… Even though you are much weaker than me, you do not have any problems.<br />
As expected, like noonim said, there is something wrong with me.  </p>
<p>com Even though Yoohyun and I got along well, there was no way all S-Rank Hunters and their family who were weaker than them, were fine.  </p>
<p>People are all different.<br />
It is the same even for normal families, not just Hunters.<br />
Even with the same family composition and environment, the relationships can be bad, or can be good.<br />
Not only that, it could be good and then become bad, or be bad and then become good.<br />
We didn’t not have conflicts either.<br />
Even just a while ago, I grumbled that he really didn’t listen.  </p>
<p>In those relationships between people, it could be one side’s fault, or it could be both, all of their faults, but the way I see it, it is Riette’s fault, not Noah-ssi’s.<br />
Of course, I do not know either of you that well, but I do feel it certainly.<br />
Riette does not listen to Noah-ssi.<br />
Her own opinions are the priority, and her own thoughts are absolute.<br />
The person who blocked her ears is also the one who is much stronger, so how could you go up against her?I’m strong and I’m amazing and even the guardian, so it means follow me unconditionally.<br />
Whether that was through water or fire or a thorny path.  </p>
<p>So Noah-ssi is not weak.<br />
Rather, it is the opposite.<br />
You firmly endured well up to now.<br />
You did not give up, and made your own guild, and even wanted to help me.<br />
It would have been easier to let go, but you did not.<br />
Noah-ssi is plenty strong.<br />
You really endured well to now.<br />
-……Han Yoojin-ssi.<br />
Stop crying.<br />
com At the tearful words, I turned to look at Yoohyun.  </p>
<p>…Use that skill again.<br />
And speaking of, what was the name.<br />
Teacher.<br />
I cut off the front part.<br />
Terrifying Hatchling Class Teacher – it wasn’t even funny.<br />
Though it was terrifying until just a while ago.<br />
I used the skill on Noah and Yoohyun again.<br />
Noah accepted it without any rejection this time too.<br />
After unilaterally connecting Noah’s sensations to Yoohyun, I went to the hunched over dragon.<br />
Seeing him up close, he looked smaller instead, than when I saw him from afar.<br />
Would his total length be about 5 meters? If you just considered his body, then he wasn’t that big.<br />
The dense and smooth scales were golden, but when their light decreased, they were closer to white.<br />
He was a sleek and pretty dragon.<br />
Looking at the size of the wings and the body’s shape, he would be able to fly at a considerably fast speed as long as he got used to it.<br />
There were a lot of cases where curse and poison dragons didn’t have wings, but he was unusual.<br />
And he had an S-Rank poison skill and even sprayed miasma, so to a Hunter with high poison resistance, he would be a really good kiseungsu… no, he was a person.<br />
‘There was the healing skill and Stat Rental seemed like assistance.<br />
It seems like he has other assistance skills too.<br />
’ He was a person, but no matter how I looked at him, he really, seriously seemed like a good kiseungsu.<br />
He was normally S-Rank, and had transformed his entire body, so he would be really durable.<br />
com But among the people I knew, there were no Hunters with a strong poison resistance other than Riette.<br />
There definitely wasn’t anyone within the country, and there should be overseas.<br />
And seeing how Yoohyun cut out the poisoned injury, a fairly good item wouldn’t be able to block it.<br />
Before that though, he was a person.<br />
-Does Han Yoojin-ssi, really think like that…? Now the tears had mostly stopped, but every time he blinked, the water that had gathered became droplets and rolled down.<br />
They were above sparkling scales, so they followed suit and shone like some gems.<br />
He was pointlessly pretty, really.  </p>
<p>I do.<br />
Of course.<br />
For people who think of others, I don’t think there is anybody who is weak.<br />
-Even though noonim is still scary?.<br />
If I were Noah-ssi, I would be scared, too.<br />
And I guarantee that there are many people around who are afraid of Riette, other than Noah-ssi.<br />
There is no doubt.<br />
Here and there all over the world at least, it would be in units of hundred.<br />
Noah, who had been quietly staring at me, pushed his head a little bit forwards.<br />
I stretched out my hand, glancing at Yoohyun who was standing guard at my side, and Peace on the other side who was in a discomforted mood.<br />
I had thought he would be cold like a reptile, but there was warmth.<br />
The scales were much tougher than the still young Comet’s.<br />
com for the best novel reading experience -Until noonim is not scary anymore, I want to be by your side.  </p>
<p>You can’t.<br />
That Yoohyun said curtly.<br />
It was so firm that Noah’s wings, that had become slightly raised, dropped down again.  </p>
<p>Why – isn’t it okay? Anyways, he’s an S-Rank Hunter.<br />
Of course, it’s too much to stay here, but he could stay in the building next door.<br />
I have to receive compensation for the damage anyways, so I can just ask him to stand guard for free or something.<br />
What do you think, Noah-ssi?-I want to.<br />
Yoohyun also didn’t oppose more at the words that it would be on the other building’s side.<br />
Anyways, I had wanted to bring in an S-Rank monster or Hunter somehow, so if one came rolling in by himself, then I was thankful.  </p>
<p>Noah-ssi, can you apply the healing skill to other people as well?-Yes.<br />
It is B-Rank.  </p>
<p>Really? That is impressive.<br />
com -I do not have other healing type skills.  </p>
<p>It is enough with just that!How great was it even if it only did basic healing? On top of that it was an S-Rank Hunter.<br />
There was no need to spare his body, so it was the best in an emergency.  </p>
<p>If it is okay, could you tell me about your other skills? Of course, you do not have to.<br />
It is basic for people to hide their skills.<br />
-That is…… Noah glanced at Yoohyun.  </p>
<p>Yoohyun, can you take off your translation item for a minute?Then he would be able to understand my words, but he wouldn’t be able to understand Noah’s.<br />
Yoohyun obediently took off the translation item.<br />
When he did, Noah opened his mouth again.<br />
-They are mostly assistance skills.<br />
Before I gained the poison and beast transformation through the Dio Valshesis’ Twin title, I did not have a proper attack skill, so I could not raise my guild that much.<br />
com Then again, if he was an assistance type S-Rank, it would’ve been hard to gather good A-Rank Hunters.<br />
Considering that an S-Rank Hunter was the guild leader, it would’ve been small.<br />
Noah confessed his skills in a row to a dumbfounding amount.<br />
I wondered if this was okay, but at the Stat Rental skill’s explanation, my ears perked right up.<br />
He could lend as much as half his designated stats.  </p>
<p>It is really half?-Yes.<br />
It is possible for me to borrow as well, but the other person has to consent.<br />
The duration time is 30 minutes, and I can use it once per day.<br />
If it was 30 minutes, it wasn’t that long of a time, but it was as much as half an S-Rank Hunter’s stats.<br />
If he was assistance type, then his Mental would be on the higher side, too.<br />
Even if I raked in S-Rank integer increase items and put on as many as possible, I wouldn’t get to even half of half of Noah’s stats.<br />
This was good for other Hunters too, but wasn’t it really jackpot for me? Though it wouldn’t receive the Lauchtas’ Natural Enemy skill’s doubled effect, since Noah would be using the skill on me.<br />
‘…Wait, would the skill title sharing also get the doubled effect?’ Then the Veteran F-Rank’s attack skill reinforcement effect would be as much as four times… right, that was a title.<br />
Still, I wanted to try using it just in case.<br />
If an S-Rank poison skill became four times stronger, even a 1st Rank dragon type without a poison resistance would be dissolved down.<br />
com for a better experience My heart was pounding a little.<br />
It would be hard to use, but would the Our Kid Whatever add to a maximum of skill-stat 200%? If this could also be doubled, then it would go up to quadrupled, so it was a pity.<br />
My Brat’s growth speed would be doubled, too.<br />
It would be the same for Riette, but I didn’t have even a speck of interest in applying the keyword to that woman.<br />
‘Wait, the poison skill doesn’t work on me, so couldn’t he change in a dragon with the miasma around him and let me ride him? If the attack skills are doubled, of course A-Ranks, but even S-Rank flight monsters probably wouldn’t be able to approach.<br />
But I shouldn’t go into an S-Rank dungeon because of that……’ I shouldn’t, but I thought of a really good method of using the skill.<br />
If it worked, it would be really amazing.<br />
Anyways, really.  </p>
<p>Noah-ssi is really the best.<br />
-……Sorry? Noah was taken aback, and then wagged his tail.<br />
-They are not that, useful….<br />
No, they are all really good.<br />
com -A-and besides the title skill, I do have one S-Rank attack type skill.<br />
It is sending double the pain of my injury to my opponent.  </p>
<p>…Sorry?That… was if the Scream skill? I had thought that the skill name was vicious, but the effect didn’t seem normal either.  </p>
<p>You didn’t seem to use it a while ago.<br />
-Ah, it was because people do not have wings.<br />
The part has to be the same as well.<br />
And there is a limit on the number of times, so it seemed a waste to use it on something trivial.<br />
Instead, defense is impossible, as far as I know.<br />
……Yoohyun, now that I knew, you were in a bit of danger.<br />
But if the Scream skill also got the doubled sharing, it would be quadrupled.<br />
It was a problem that Noah had to be hurt for it to work, but it really was no joke.<br />
If Noah and I participated in a dungeon attack as assistance… I wasn’t in a position to go around in dungeons and clear them, but I wanted to try it at least once.<br />
Anyways, it was really impressive and I poured down praises again, but Yoohyun stared at me unhappily.  </p>
<p>Are that person’s skills that great.<br />
They are pretty good.<br />
Are you jealous? No matter how good they are, you’re the best.<br />
Yoohyun was satisfied and Noah became gloomy.<br />
Ah really.<br />
At this rate, it was a relief that Peace didn’t really understand words.  </p>

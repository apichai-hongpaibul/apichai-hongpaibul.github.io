<p>The S-Ranks that I’ve RaisedTranslation Ch.<br />
17 &lt; Head of Human Resources (2) .<br />
It was an antique reception room.<br />
The entire interior was Eastern[1, and the classic Western furniture was arranged suitably in an unbalanced way.<br />
With Suk Simyeong’s personality, all the antique furniture here must be genuine.<br />
As guided, I sat down on a black leather sofa and a beverage was offered.<br />
The atmosphere here also seemed like they would ask about coffee bean types.  </p>
<p>Orange juice, please.<br />
Juice for me too,Bak Yerim, who was sitting next to me, said.<br />
Sitting on the opposite side, Suk Simyeong had on a kind smile.<br />
It was a soft expression that seemed like, even if I suddenly hurled abuse at him hahaha, he would benevolently let it pass saying ‘is that so’.  </p>
<p>I would like to first thank you for choosing Haeyeon Guild preferentially,Suk Simyeong said in a, not just polite, but also sweet voice.<br />
I had thought so since I first met him, but that ahjussi’s voice was really great.<br />
With a gentlemanly face full of goodwill, as well as a good voice, he really seemed like someone born to be a business king.<br />
Yerim also seemed like she was halfway reeled in by his voice.<br />
But I, who knew well just how poisonous that ahjussi could get, stayed steady.<br />
It was stifling because you were pierced by that nice voice.  </p>
<p>To speak the truth, blood ties played a big role.<br />
Following Suk Simyeong, I put on a smile and replied.  </p>
<p>Before that, it’s also thanks to Bak Yerim-yang trusting in me.<br />
First was ahjussi’s behavior that allowed me to trust him.<br />
Yerim quickly gripped my arm.<br />
Don’t cling while we’re doing business.<br />
This is an important contract for you.  </p>
<p>Bak Yerim-nim may not have attack skills yet, but Shadowless Day and Cold Sigh are enough for you to become a combat-suited Hunter.<br />
Your Strength stat does not quite reach S-Rank average, but since it is possible for an overall buff, there should be no problem.<br />
Suk Simyeong explained considerably accurately about Yerim’s situation.<br />
He didn’t know, but the past Bak Yerim was a combat magician so the Strength stat wasn’t very important.<br />
If she smoothly gets ice-related attack skills, she’ll just need to add a Mana stat buff and ice-attribute skill buff… She’d be unparalleled.<br />
If she also got an additional buff, she’d be able to just sweep away any monsters.<br />
Not to mention, Hermes’ Sandals was an agility buff and flight, with added teleportation; it was a total scam.<br />
I stared at Yerim anew.  </p>
<p>What are you doing.<br />
Ah, nothing.<br />
com Since I gave optimized skills to an S-Rank, the connection was no joke.<br />
Even when she just used ice-related magic, she was strong, but now she had become a total monster.<br />
She would outshine[2 Yoohyun.<br />
‘Speaking of, I should check Yoohyun’s status window too.<br />
’ There was still a lot of waiting time left for the My Brat skill, so I hadn’t checked.<br />
That guy also might have optimized skills he didn’t get so I should check and use my skill on him.  </p>
<p>A combat Hunter’s guild contract conditions are usually payment mainly in dungeon quotas and equipment.<br />
In the case of A-Rank and higher dungeons, each guild has their own quotas.<br />
A guild’s status differed according to how well it could manage A-Rank and higher dungeons.<br />
The current Haeyeon Guild probably mangaged the most dungeons after the 3 big guilds?.<br />
Bak Yerim-nim is still a minor so you can start attacking B-Rank dungeons.<br />
If you wish to attack A-Rank and higher a little sooner, I recommend clearing dungeons that are around C or D 10 times.<br />
We don’t want to rush attacking higher rank dungeons,I said.<br />
Yerim was only just fifteen years old.<br />
Rather than rashly attacking A and higher dungeons, it would be better to get used to combat and using the skills in mid-to-low rank dungeons.<br />
As a combat magician, the ability to apply skills was especially important so getting enough practice was important.  </p>
<p>For 1 year starting from now on, we want to prioritize growth.<br />
That is an excellent choice.<br />
Suk Simyeong gave a small nod.  </p>
<p>We would also prefer to advise that route.<br />
Slowly gaining experience and cooperating with various guild members, and then forming a new S-Rank attack team is the best road to take.<br />
In an S-Rank dungeon attack team, at least one S-Rank combat hunter needed to be included.<br />
So for Haeyeon Guild, it was more advantageous for Bak Yerim to gain experience and make her own team instead of joining Yoohyun’s team.<br />
Since having two S-Rank attack teams meant that you could get the rights to several more jointly managed S-Rank dungeons.  </p>
<p>However, in that case, the contract period naturally becomes longer.<br />
In return, we will not hold back on the support Bak Yerim-nim will require for growth.<br />
I know there aren’t any S-Ranks yet that have exclusively contracted with a specific guild.<br />
Domestic S-Ranks were all guild leaders except for one who was affiliated with the government.<br />
Foreign ones were still mostly guild leaders or government-affiliated, and the remaining minority were all free agents, according to my memory.<br />
Free Hunters weren’t affiliated with anywhere and worked by cooperating through short-term contracts whenever the government or guilds requested for them.<br />
com for a better experience.<br />
So even if she didn’t didn’t attack dungeons and was only affiliated, it would be a considerable profit for Haeyeon Guild.<br />
Increasing the contract period with the excuse of growth support is excessive greed.<br />
A guild that has two S-Rank Hunters! Even worldwide, it would be the first and only, so even just the value of holding that title would probably increase a lot.<br />
The more I thought of it, it really made no sense that Yoohyun was so nitpicky about the guardian issue.<br />
Was that any way to behave as a guild leader? Not just setting up as a guardian, you should’ve made sure to stamp the contract even if you had to sell your hyung.  </p>
<p>You seem to have a better grasp on the Hunter community than I had thought.<br />
Suk Simyeong had a surprised expression on his face.<br />
I lived in that neighborhood for over 4 years.<br />
At rock bottom, I couldn’t thoroughly know the world of high rank Hunters, but was there anyone who would know the general trends better than me? Currently there wouldn’t be any.<br />
If there weren’t any prophets, I was the best.  </p>
<p>As you said, even just Bak Yerim-nim becoming affiliated to our guild is a great profit for us.<br />
It seems I was beaten[3 by rashly trying to rake in this profit.<br />
Opposite to his words, Suk Simyeong looked like he was in a pretty good mood.<br />
In the case of A-Rank Hunters, renewal every year with an upper limit of 200% according to performance, starting from the 2nd year in a standard 5-year contract, is an average contract condition.<br />
Thus, what do you think of a renewal without an upper limit every year according to performance, starting from the 1st year of a 3-year contract?Future guild-affiliated S-Ranks would usually set up contracts in 1-year increments, recontract with updated conditions.<br />
But considering Yerim’s age and Haeyeon Guild’s growth rate, a 3-year contract wasn’t bad.<br />
After 3 years, she would be 18 years old, so she wouldn’t need my help anymore and it was suitable.  </p>
<p>What do you think?As I turned to Yerim and asked, she shook her head slightly.  </p>
<p>I didn’t really understand.<br />
Ahjussi can choose for me.<br />
Basically, you’ll be affiliated with Haeyeon Guild for 3 years.<br />
You won’t be able to go to another guild.<br />
I, well… I’m just like this? Guilds with a certain amount of awareness don’t take in F-Ranks.<br />
It might be possible with guild that was basically a friendly neighborhood gathering with a D-Rank or lower guild leader, but with even a C-Rank guild leader, F-Ranks weren’t allowed.<br />
No, they did use those that weren’t Hunters as handymen.  </p>
<p>No[4.<br />
Ahjussi should also contract for 3 years,Bak Yerim said firmly.<br />
Was being her guardian not enough so she was trying to add more? Why was she being like this?.<br />
I can put that in my contract conditions, right.<br />
Of course, it is possible.<br />
Yerim and Suk Simeyong talked back and forth.<br />
Won’t you kindly ask for my opinion as well?.<br />
Contract, what contract.<br />
I’m not doing it.<br />
I’m just going to help you take your place and pl[5…rest.<br />
I was going to give up on Kim Sunghan and just use my skills on and raise Yerim and Yoo Myeongwoo, Yoohyun too, from time to time.<br />
com for the best novel reading experience At my words, Bek Yerim looked like she was about to cry.  </p>
<p>You said you would take responsibility! 3 years, just contract for 3 years!Stop pulling my arm.<br />
It hurts.  </p>
<p>Even without contracting, I’ll be your guardian for 3 years so don’t worry.<br />
If you can’t believe that then I’ll write up a new contract for me.<br />
But it’s better to go into the same guild.<br />
My dongsaeng is the guild leader here.<br />
I just didn’t officialy contract, but I’m basically halfway in.<br />
So I’m not going anywhere.<br />
I was going to chillax[6 here so where would I go? Yerim nodded her head with a little more relieved expression.  </p>
<p>Okay.<br />
You’re really not going anywhere else.<br />
I’m not.<br />
There isn’t anywhere that would take me either.<br />
com Right now, that is.<br />
Once I raised familiars, any guild would welcome me with both arms out.<br />
Though I had no intention of moving.<br />
After appeasing Yerim, I started negotiating the contract conditions again.<br />
An S-Rank Hunter’s base pay was about 10 million dollars[7 per year.<br />
It seemed like a little, but as stated, that was the base pay; the real earnings came from the dungeons, and in the case of S-Rank dungeons, the average distribution ratio was 8:2.<br />
The preparation expenses for dungeon attacks were all paid by the guild, and the attack team took the 8.<br />
The team leader S-Rank Hunter took at least 5 and at most 8 from the attack team’s earnings, according to their contribution.<br />
Ten million dollars were nothing compared to attacking one S-Rank dungeon.<br />
So most Hunters looked at the earnings distribution ratio rather than the base pay.  </p>
<p>It should be your first time with a Hunter contract but it seems as if you are more proficient at adjusting it than I am,Suk Simyeong said, looking at the increasing condition details.<br />
That was because ahjussi hadn’t even reached his 3rd year and I was on my 4th.<br />
And if you considered just the amount of information, there was a difference of 4 and a half years, so I could only be more proficient.<br />
I’d seen the S-Rank Hunter feature series from the Hunter special channel over and over again more than 10 times.<br />
I learned about contract conditions pretty well.  </p>
<p>This could become the standard S-Rank combat Hunter contract.<br />
Although, I do not know when we will be able to recruit another S-Rank Hunter.<br />
That was the standard contract.<br />
After the Awakening Centers were created and the number of S-Ranks slowly increased, all sorts of cases went through and it came out after about 2 years.<br />
com Specifically, it was the standard contract slightly altered to fit Yerim’s situation.<br />
Since the standard contract was for adult combat Hunters.  </p>
<p>We won’t use S-Rank equipment priority rights and auction rights yet.<br />
It’ll be better to decide after checking her skills at level 10.<br />
10 levels would be quick to pass.<br />
It’d be good if Pale Rain appeared.<br />
Then she could take ice-related equipment.  </p>
<p>All right.<br />
It seems you are perfect in various ways.<br />
Enough to earn Bak Yerim-nim’s trust.<br />
You seem like someone who has been active in the Hunter community for several years.<br />
Haha, I just Awakened a few days ago.<br />
Did I act like I knew too much? But it seemed like a waste to not use the knowledge I’d already gathered.<br />
After finishing up adjusting the contract conditions and printing out the contract, it was signed.<br />
Thumbprints were added too.<br />
Yerim rubbed the ink on her fingers onto the back of my hand.<br />
Hey, brat, don’t draw a heart.  </p>
<p>You can go right to register as an Awakened Person tomorrow.<br />
I will send you the details.<br />
com for the best novel reading experience He probably also contacted journalists.<br />
Since it’d be an event that would be a huge topic, they’d probably package it up fancily.  </p>
<p>And these are the inheritances and related materials that should be returned to Bak Yerim-nim.<br />
You will be able to use them well.<br />
Suk Simyeong handed over a document envelope.<br />
Oh, thanks.  </p>
<p>We’ll use them well.<br />
That should be about it right? I was about to stand up from my seat when Suk Simyeong grabbed onto me.  </p>
<p>Please wait a moment.<br />
Sorry[8? Is there something else left?It seemed like we were done.<br />
Suk Simyeong’s determined gaze pierced me.  </p>
<p>I would like to contract with Han Yoojin-ssi.<br />
com …Why me again? I said I wouldn’t! [1 the dictionary gives me the definition of the word as ‘Or*ental’ but that’s a borderline slur so… [2 lit.<br />
‘hit [Yoohyun’s cheek’ [3 lit.  </p>
<p>hit by one blow(or even more literally,.<br />
made to eat one bang”), which means what it sounds like, i.<br />
e.<br />
‘beget beaten’, ‘get one’s butt kicked’, etc.<br />
[4 lit.  </p>
<p>that can’t behappenbut it’s one of the ways you say.<br />
noin krn, but with a connotations of.<br />
no, I don’t want thator.<br />
no, that’s not right[5 he cuts off in the middle of a word so I’m not 100% sure what he was about to say but I’m p sure it was gonna be.<br />

As for the tl, sorry, I couldn’t resist.<br />

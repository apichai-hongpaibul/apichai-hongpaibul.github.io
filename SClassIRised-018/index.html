    <h1 id="the-s-classes-that-i-raised-18">The S-Classes That I Raised-18.</h1>
<p>The S-Ranks that I’ve RaisedTranslation Ch.<br />
18 &lt; Head of Human Resources (3) .  </p>
<p>I’m sorry but I’m fine the way I am now.<br />
I made my decision to live peacefully on top of a king lizard’s carapace.<br />
…That said, there was a lot of unfinished work, but leaving the precious skills I’d already gotten to collect dust was bit of a waste.<br />
Anyways, I was definitely not going to put myself forward and would live quietly and comfortably.  </p>
<p>Please think it over again,Suk Simyeong said, not giving up.  </p>
<p>Soon, it will become easy for anybody to try to Awaken.<br />
With the upcoming era where, according to the Hunter Association prediction, the number of domestic Awakened People will break through five million in 1 year, and more than 2 thirds of the population will become Awakened People in 3 years, is it not regretful to not display Han Yoojin-ssi’s abilities at this point in time?Regretful, yeah right.<br />
With the way he was speaking, you’d mistake me for some kind of rare scout.  </p>
<p>Thank you for regarding me highly, but Bak Yerim-yang’s situation was nothing but chance.<br />
There is hardly any probability of finding yet another lucky break like that.<br />
Was what I said, but if I wanted to, I could find more people with the aptitude to become S-Ranks and optimally Awaken them.<br />
But I wouldn’t.<br />
This much was enough, why would I do more? Even just Yerim was troublesome enough.<br />
I was just going to give Yoo Myeongwoo his SS-Rank skill and put him in the guild, and then be done with it.<br />
Of course, I am not expecting you to bring over another S-Rank Awakened Person.<br />
That goes beyond excessive into a theft-like disposition.<br />
In fact, you do not have to scout new Awakened People at all.<br />
…Then?Suk Simyeong replied, with a twinkle in his eyes that didn’t suit him,.<br />
With that keen insight and analytical skills, you can create[1 a new system for the Hunter community together with us-.<br />
I can’t!What was this ahjussi talking about! Insight or analysis or whatever, no matter how hard I work[2 I don’t have it! I’m actually cheating[3.<br />
I saw the answer sheet, in the future.  </p>
<p>Han Yoojin-ssi.<br />
I won’t, I can’t.<br />
I don’t have that ability! I didn’t even get into college.<br />
I even left high school by taking the GED.<br />
Give up at least with this lowly educational background.  </p>
<p>com for the best novel reading experience …I was about to swear.<br />
Go look up a job search site, there are plenty that filter out lower than college grads, okay? If you haven’t suffered though a situation where you couldn’t even submit your documents, then please shut your mouth.  </p>
<p>Anyways I can’t do it, I won’t do it, I really don’t know how to do something like that.<br />
Even if you cut off my hand I won’t sign.<br />
I was just going to sometimes use my skills and raise pets, living off my amazing dongsaeng.<br />
As I blocked up my ears and insisted I definitely won’t, Suk Simyeong seemed to give up eventually.  </p>
<p>All right.<br />
Then instead of human resources, let us make a general contract.<br />
Can’t I stay halfway attached like now? I don’t have any reason to join an attack team or set foot in a dungeon claimed by Haeyeon.<br />
The Hunter license guarantee and training are short-term so it is fine but to move to the employee dorms, you have to sign a contract.<br />
Especially because you will be entering, not anywhere else, but the residence targeted toward high-ranking Hunters.<br />
Even if you are the guild leader’s family member, you have to be clear about your affiliation.<br />
Suk Simyeong erased the agitated expression he had just a while ago and explained in a calm voice.<br />
I guess since I had to be near Yerim, I couldn’t go into the normal[4 employee dorms.<br />
Though, Yoohyun’s house was company housing so if I, his brother, went and lived there, it wouldn’t be weird.<br />
Alright.<br />
But if it’s possible, I want to contract as a normal employee, not as a guild member.<br />
Do you mean you do not want to receive the support for Hunters.<br />
Yes.<br />
I want to receive just the training and then after that I don’t have any intention of working as a Hunter.<br />
At any rate, the only places I could go into were low rank dungeons.<br />
That much I could go into with my own money.<br />
I had enough equipment thanks to Yoohyun.<br />
I was thinking of making a contract with Haeyeon Guild each time I raised a familiar, instead of working as an affiliated guild member.<br />
That way I could raise enough, and play enough.<br />
As expected, being a freelancer was the best.  </p>
<p>It is possible, but instead, the conditions will be lowered.<br />
Currently, Han Yoojin-ssi has no intention of working other than your role as Bak Yerim-nim’s guardian, is that right.<br />
Yes.<br />
If that’s possible.<br />
Frankly speaking, Han Yoojin-ssi’s educational background and work experience fall short of Haeyeon Guild’s standard hiring qualification requirements.<br />
com …A while ago you were saying things like educational background didn’t matter.<br />
As soon as the situation changed, so did his words.  </p>
<p>Of course, discovering an S-Rank Awakened Person and successfully contracting them is enough to qualify to enter.<br />
The problem is afterwards.<br />
The first one or two months or so should be fine, but if you receive pay without doing any work, there will be talk.<br />
Since, strictly speaking, being Bak Yerim-nim’s guardian is not guild business.<br />
So it was that problem.<br />
I didn’t really care.<br />
Even if some gossip came out, I’d already been publicly shamed[5 before, so it wouldn’t even tickle me.<br />
There probably weren’t many who had been cyberbullied as much as me? ……Now that it had been brought up, I was feeling a little depressed.  </p>
<p>That’s fine.<br />
For the conditions, please just put in the minimum wage.<br />
I didn’t have to receive much pay.<br />
Even if I failed to apply the keyword to Peace, I still had stocks left.<br />
I remembered the name of the pharmaceutical company that developed the hair loss remedy, and I knew the companies that would have rising stocks thanks to the stream of S-Ranks that would come out the Awakening Centers.<br />
For the stocks, I could cover that with my severance pay and my past savings, so the pay could just be enough to live off of.<br />
What was the current minimum wage again? Was it around 8 thousand won[6?.<br />
Minimum wage.<br />
It is unbearable to put that in as you will not even be working,Suk Simyeong said, smiling.<br />
He didn’t mean he wouldn’t give it at all, by any chance, right?.<br />
How about 5 thousand yearly for a condition of doing human reasources work when requested? Within 10 hours per week.<br />
…Please make it so that I can only use the company cafetaria.<br />
No thanks.<br />
I won’t take it.<br />
Just let me eat.<br />
Working 10 hours per week for a yearly income of 5 thousand[7 would be child’s play, but I didn’t want to even step foot into the human reasources team that had that ahjussi.<br />
He’d take everything I have.  </p>
<p>If you speak like that then I suppose there is no helping it.<br />
Suk Simyeong nodded, putting on a bitter smile.  </p>
<p>As you want, we will only provide room and board.<br />
……Really just room and board? I mean, in these situations, shouldn’t you be a little more caring? Cutting things off and throwing them away with no basis, this ahjussi definitely had a bad personality, unlike his outer appearance.  </p>
<p>Please contact me anytime if you happen to find a passion for work.<br />
……Yes.<br />
Rather than rumors of nepotism coming out, I’d probably get lots of sympathetic gazes.<br />
Beside me, even Yerim was sending me pitying looks.  </p>
<p>Don’t worry, ahjussi.<br />
I’m rich now.<br />
I have enough money too.<br />
Though I’d have to save up and buy stocks.<br />
Ah, but this was really too much.<br />
I even brought over and presented an S-Rank Awakened Person and all I got was room and board? Just in case, I snuck a glance at Suk Simyeong, who was straightening up documents.  </p>
<p>Is there no incentive for Bak Yerim-yang’s successful contract.<br />
Since it was a matter that occurred before you joined, of course there is not.<br />
Ah, should I add an incentive condition?…That there wasn’t any because it was before I joined, it felt like I was scammed.<br />
Should I have tried to earn something when we were working on Yerim’s contract? I looked out only for the kid.<br />
But there was still one thing left.  </p>
<p>Please add a condition for an incentive if I successfully contract with an S-Rank Awakened Person or A-Rank that is equivalent to an S-Rank, like a saint.<br />
Yoo Myeongwoo.<br />
If you had an SS-Rank production skill, you’d be treated almost like S-Rank, like saints were, even if you couldn’t go into an S-Rank dungeon.<br />
I was orginally just going to bring him in, but because I felt wronged, I should get paid.<br />
com At my words, Suk Simyeong put on an easygoing smile and took out a pen.  </p>
<p>I will add it to a certain extent.<br />
Please tell me the sum of money, as well as reward, you want.<br />
As I was about to tell him to just give me 100 billion, I stopped.<br />
At any rate, with time, I wouldn’t be so short on money.<br />
So instead of money.  </p>
<p>Do you happen to know the fact that I am raising a baby Horned Flame Lion.<br />
Yes, I was informed by Guild Leader.<br />
How should I say this, that guy is pretty cute.<br />
He follows me pretty well.<br />
So I want to receive one baby monster around the same rank as a Horned Flame Lion, or three baby monsters that are one level in rank lower.<br />
With the condition that Haeyeon Guild will shoulder the taming and rearing costs.<br />
Baby monsters?Suk Simyeong had a rare surprised expression.<br />
Then again, it was something shocking.<br />
Since I choose pets over money or items.<br />
But the monsters that I would receive from the incentive would be entirely mine, unlike Peace, who was owned by Yoohyun and raised with his money.<br />
com for a better experience If it was similar in rank to a Horned Flame Lion, I could take it into and attack a B-Rank dungeon, so it couldn’t be compared to some small amount of money.<br />
If I failed to apply the keyword, then well, I’d just gain one more pet.<br />
Since I wouldn’t be raising them with my money, it wouldn’t be a loss.<br />
Later, when the monster raising regulations ease up, should I go out on broadcasts? It’d be popular.  </p>
<p>…It is not an impossible condition but it is unusual.<br />
Do you have some other purpose?Suk Simyeong tilted his head, with a completely confused look on his face.  </p>
<p>Does it seem like I do.<br />
It would make sense if you do, but… I do not know.<br />
I will add in the condition for now.<br />
However, high ranking baby monsters are difficult to catch, and do not often appear in auctions, so the payment may be late.<br />
S-Rank Awakened People don’t appear often either, haha.<br />
Of course, I was planning on making Yoo Myeongwoo into an SS-Rank production skill holder.<br />
If I used My Brat about three times, he’d probably be able to gain it, right? We finished my joining and finally stood up from our seats.<br />
It would be great if I didn’t see this ahjussi for a long time.<br />
Then I suppose we will see each other often from now on.<br />
What was he saying.<br />
I wasn’t going to even glance at the human reasources team and was going to avoid them.<br />
…He wouldn’t come find me or something, right? When we went outside, I examined Yerim’s parents’ inheritance materials that we received from Suk Simyeong.<br />
A 50-pyeong[8 apartment was sold off, and a commercial building was sold off with the excuse that it would be too hard to manage.<br />
After snatching up this much, you couldn’t even buy the kid sneakers? What a lack of conscience.<br />
[9.<br />
You’re really not going to take legal action?At my question, Yerim nodded her head with an uninterested expression.  </p>
<p>I don’t want to be involved with them for a long time.<br />
Anyways you said my base pay was over 10 billion yearly.<br />
That was so, but.<br />
Then again, thinking of the future, it would be better to release the leeches after letting them take enough.<br />
It would be annoying if they kept on trying to contact us and kicked up a fuss by going on broadcasts with teary pleas.<br />
Then let’s drop by the legal team and get the necessary materials, and go directly to them.<br />
Since it’s still the morning, the restaurant wouldn’t be open, right.<br />
On Sundays, they open at 1 pm, so we should go to the house.<br />
Yerim told me the house address.<br />
So they lived in a good neighborhood.<br />
Then again, how much was it that they snatched up? That said, the shop looked deserted and shabby.<br />
They wouldn’t have squandered the inheritance already, right? Then it would be even easier to grab their weakpoint.<br />
[1 the verb comes last in krn (S DO V, or DO S V, etc.<br />
) so there is no verb in this cut off sentence, but eng doesn’t work like that so I had to make do.<br />
[2 lit.<br />
‘make porridge and give to a dog’ which means ‘do fruitless work’‘work hard for no results’ ‘work hard and someone else takes the credit’ [3 excellent example of konglish slang: the word itself is ‘cunning’ transliterated into krn, but it means ‘to cheat, cheating’.<br />
[4 not ‘normal’ as in ‘not unusual’ but like ‘normal person’‘ordinary person’ so I’m assuming it means ‘non-Hunter’ [5 lit.<br />
‘suffered 조리돌림 by the past public’ where 조리돌림 is the noun form of the verb 조리돌리다, which the krn-eng dictionary I checked defines as ‘draglead a malefactor through the streets to expose them to public shame’.<br />
So.<br />
com [6 the word for wagepay used so far meant monthly pay fyi [7 i’m assuming it’s 5 thousand something (50 million perhaps? Krn counts in intervals of 4 digits instead of 3 like in eng, so it would most likely be 5 thousand ten-thousand) instead of just 5 thousand itself otherwise this makes no sense, but the raws just say this [8 pyeong is a way of counting land space and 1 pyeong is apparently 3.<br />
3058 m2 or 35.<br />
583 ft2 [9 lit.  </p>

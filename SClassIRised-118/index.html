<p>&lt; Superior Rank Bait (1) .<br />
Was it because of the backdrop of the gloomy gray sky and the buildings that had collapsed and burned? Song Taewon’s two eyes were beyond being heavy to feeling gloomy.<br />
Though it was a situation where it would be tiring from his standpoint, it didn’t seem like he was simply sick of it.<br />
He seemed like a tiger that was starved and had become a mess from being swept away by a tempest, but still had left enough strength for a last leap.<br />
The target was none other than me.<br />
It was a gaze that might’ve made me break out a little in goosebumps, if I didn’t have the fear resistance.<br />
‘Still, Song Taewon probably isn’t related to this matter.<br />
’ If he was a man flexible enough to pull nonsense like putting false charges on an innocent person, he would be living much more comfortably.<br />
As a high ranking public servant and an S-Rank Hunter, he probably wouldn’t have acted like a self-restraining ascetic.<br />
As a petit bourgeois once upon a time, I had humane goodwill toward him, but at the same time, I very slightly understood Sung Hyunjae’s car crashing high handedness.<br />
It was stifling.<br />
‘And it would be incredibly difficult.<br />
’ Seeing how he sensitively checked my status, I became reluctant to even apply the keyword.<br />
In fact, the easiest and fastest method would be to just throw him away.<br />
Since, if just Song Taewon wasn’t there, the Hunter Association would naturally lose their strength.<br />
Even so, I didn’t want that person to end up at the same outcome as before the regression.<br />
What should I do? I was wondering if I should talk to him first, when Song Taewon turned around.<br />
I stared at his back as he conversed briefly with the people setting up a restriction line around the wreckage and then went past that.<br />
The wide but heavy-looking shoulders made my mood weird.<br />
Yoohyun.<br />
You’re not bugging my phone, right?I asked, turning my head.  </p>
<p>I’m not.<br />
And the radius for the block isn’t that large either.<br />
Above all, the opposition from the surroundings will be fierce, so bugging is impossible.<br />
If I thought about the people contacting me, it made sense.  </p>
<p>Were there no people who opposed having their phones blocked.<br />
Since I said it was only for the vacation.<br />
Seseong and Breaker also agreed.<br />
I was going to deal with them while you were resting.<br />
Yoohyun glanced around at the collapsed buildings.  </p>
<p>It seems like the Breaker Guild Leader’s lips were too loose.<br />
She tried to not tell me.<br />
I forcefully probed into it.<br />
What did you give away this time?The end of the gaze that returned to me was sharp.<br />
I was pretending to be calm because it wouldn’t do for it to be caught that I made this mess, but as expected, it seemed like that little brother’s mood wasn’t pleasant.<br />
What did I give away – he was probably talking about the price for overturning the buildings.  </p>
<p>Just what I normally do.<br />
I mean, I was also going to be quiet this time, but they acted so pettily.<br />
If they had unhesitatingly set the whole building on fire, I would’ve been like ‘hm, Yoohyun seems to have gotten a little angry’ and watched the fire.<br />
…Or, that wasn’t it.<br />
I probably would’ve been thinking of ways to settle it.<br />
Anyways, I wouldn’t have directly come and turned things over.  </p>
<p>Alright.<br />
I had been resolved in my own way, but my brother surprisingly stood down easily.<br />
How weird.<br />
Just then, one more car arrived.<br />
The person who came out from the car took a picture of the buildings’ wreckage with an expensive-looking camera.<br />
The moment I wondered if it was a journalist, one more person came out of the car.<br />
While carrying a large bouquet of flowers.<br />
It was my first time seeing this person, but I thought that I knew where they were affiliated to.  </p>
<p>Han Yoojin-nim.<br />
The bouquet came before me.<br />
They were roses.<br />
Thin drops of rain were dangling from them so they looked even more fresh.<br />
com for the best novel reading experience.<br />
The Seseong Guild Leader asked to convey that he is incredibly sorry he could not become audience to an amazing stage.<br />
Ah, yes.<br />
To think that he just sent someone even after hearing the news.<br />
He wasn’t that kind of person, though.<br />
‘It looks like saying it was lightly or whatever, wasn’t a simple excuse.<br />
’ It was obvious that there was a different reason for why he couldn’t come.<br />
Was he doing something somewhere? I was going to accept the bouquet without much thought when, Hwareureuk- The roses lit on fire splendidly.  </p>
<p>You can’t accept things like that carelessly, hyung.<br />
That is true.<br />
Bouquets are especially even more dangerous.<br />
You cannot know if there is something hidden inside.<br />
com It seems like you have received a bouquet with a knife embedded into it before, Noah-ssi.<br />
Even if a blade was inside, it wouldn’t be bad.<br />
And I could get my fingers pricked a little and then insist he forgive the debt with that.  </p>
<p>It seems like the two of you are right.<br />
While you’re at it, what about becoming friends?At the nonsensically tossed words, Yoohyun and Noah frowned at the same time.<br />
Woah, their expressions were similar, too.<br />
If I put them together often, wouldn’t they feel at least reluctant attachment[1? Wasn’t it that boys became friendly as they fought? When I thought of those two hanging out, my mood became better on its own.<br />
The visual was also good.<br />
What did young people do to play nowadays?.<br />
There is one more thing he sent.<br />
The Seseong Guild member was a little surprised at the bouquet burning, but soon they calmly took out a small box.<br />
It would probably be difficult to work under Sung Hyunjae if you were taken aback by small things like this.  </p>
<p>Don’t burn it this time.<br />
I said to Yoohyun as I quickly accepted the box.<br />
When I opened the top, a wrist watch appeared.  </p>
<p>It is a watch for Hunter use that can be stored in the inventory.<br />
com for a better experience I was thinking of getting one anyways.  </p>
<p>It is not a stage I prepared, but as he is purposely saying he will hand in a viewing fee, I will accept.<br />
Seeing how each component had to be made with dungeon byproducts, Hunter-use watches were things that were expensive and it took a long time for even the order to be accepted.<br />
So, I should gratefully-.  </p>
<p>…I had also put in an order, though.<br />
Yoohyun mumbled softly.<br />
Ah, then wait.  </p>
<p>I will accept just the thoughts behind it.<br />
I immediately closed the box and returned the watch as if throwing it back.<br />
I didn’t need it.<br />
The Seseong Guild member was at a loss, but quietly drew back.<br />
I wanted to talk to Song Taewon before we left, but he looked busy sorting out the site.<br />
It was reported as a higher-than-A-Rank dungeon break, so it would be hectic for him for a long time.<br />
Since it became that only the giant dragon that looked like the boss monster was disposed of, there would probably be a search around the area for the remaining monsters.<br />
I was becoming a little sorry.<br />
You shouldn’t send a false report, but the Association sent out a false article first, so let us call it even.<br />
I’m sorry, but there’s only one seat left.<br />
Yoohyun said to Noah, with a face that wasn’t sorry at all.<br />
And then he grabbed my arm and pushed me into the front passenger seat.<br />
He probably didn’t purposely bring a car that only had two seats, right? Before I could say anything to Noah, the car started.<br />
It wasn’t that he wouldn’t be able find his way home, but wasn’t it too much to leave him like that?.<br />
You said you’ll quietly rest.<br />
Yoohyun said, racing through the road that was originally on the deserted side but was even more completely empty because of the restricted passage.<br />
Though he said he understood a while ago.<br />
It really looked like he didn’t plan on quietly letting it go.  </p>
<p>Officially, I didn’t do anything.<br />
I only came to see my brother.<br />
Hyung.<br />
So what were you planning on doing? While your reputation is falling.<br />
Along with the sound of the wheels scratching the asphalt, the car stopped on the side of the road.<br />
Suddenly my hand felt empty.<br />
If would’ve been good if I could pet Peace or Chirpie.<br />
If I tell you.<br />
You’ll step forward again.<br />
I’ll do that even if you don’t tell me.<br />
The glaring gaze stung.<br />
I wanted to touch Peace’s fur.<br />
It was warm and soft.  </p>
<p>Wouldn’t it be better for you to tell me instead of me rummaging around.<br />
How about being dragged home like this? I’ll put in Peace and Chirpie, too.<br />
Yoohyun was probably talking about his house.<br />
If he blocked the mini portal, I wouldn’t be able to move.<br />
Though there was the final choice of asking Peace to break a window and jumping down.  </p>
<p>Do whatever you want.<br />
…What.<br />
After you tell me.<br />
I’m curious.<br />
com for a better experience After a short silence, my brother opened his mouth with a softer voice.  </p>
<p>Inside the Association, possibly among the people involved, there are guys who are trying to make a deal with foreign countries.<br />
With other countries.<br />
It’s presumably with China or Russia, but it’s not certain.<br />
The objective of those guys is you.<br />
According to Hyuna-ssi, our government apparently wants to put a leash on me.<br />
Opinions are still divided for that.<br />
You’re on the cooperative side, so the side saying to let sleeping dogs lie[2 is predominant.<br />
Then again, if they persecuted me so I ran off overseas, it would get troublesome.<br />
Since I would be welcomed wherever I went.  </p>
<p>It’s already been let out that you can know Unawakened People’s expected Awakening rank.<br />
From a dictator’s standpoint, being able to raise Awakened People, in addition to the monsters, within the country should be incredibly attractive.<br />
Especially since it’ll be easy to train young Unawakened People.<br />
Were they thinking of brainwashing kids and forming something like Awakened People troops? It was something far removed from love for humanity.<br />
I hadn’t thought of the idea of using me in that way.<br />
There were quite a lot of dirty people in the world.<br />
I don’t know what bastard it is, but how much are they going to receive that they would sell off people?Though it wasn’t anything new in a situation where there were people who would sell off their country.  </p>
<p>Still, stealing me away wouldn’t be easy.<br />
There’s always S-Ranks Hunters around.<br />
Noah was stationed here, and there was Peace, and the building right next door was Haeyeon Guild, so it was teeming with S-Ranks.<br />
Even when I went outside lately, there weren’t any instances where an S-Rank Hunter wasn’t following me.  </p>
<p>With the current state, it’s realistically impossible.<br />
If it wasn’t, I would’ve locked you up until it was resolved.<br />
That sounds like you absolutely had no intention of getting my agreement? There’s also other people connected to me.<br />
You told me to do whatever I wanted.<br />
And the others should all agree.<br />
That’s right, well.<br />
It seemed so.<br />
They would probably come over to hang out a lot.<br />
Though Sung Hyunjae didn’t need to.  </p>
<p>com for the best novel reading experience.<br />
More accurately, they tried to induce that.<br />
The Seseong Guild Leader was the first to figure out that the information about you had leaked out.<br />
Since secreting the one and only special skill user Hunter to overseas is none other than a betrayal of your country, if it’s just revealed, the Association can receive a large blow, so he looked for my cooperation.<br />
How did that person manage to find that out.<br />
I don’t know in detail, but it seems like the Seseong Guild Leader has a lot of connections outside of the country.<br />
And considerably widely and deeply, at that.<br />
It was no joke.<br />
But if I thought about how Sung Hyunjae contracted with the lizard owner guy right after Awakening and accepted this and that, it wasn’t surprising.<br />
It might be that there were numerous high rank Hunters he had placed leashes on, like Noah, around the world.<br />
…I was a little worried for my future.<br />
Should I tell him we should clear our relationship at least now? But I couldn’t miss out on someone who was that impressive.  </p>
<p>If I showed a weak appearance, those guys would definitely approach, so I purposely gave them an excuse to attack.<br />
Since when? When you went into the dungeon just with Peace.<br />
It was around then.<br />
It hasn’t been long.<br />
com for a better experience At my question, Yoohyun smiled.  </p>
<p>No.<br />
I just held back less.<br />
It wasn’t that he didn’t hold back, but that he held back less?.<br />
What about fighting with Noah-ssi.<br />
At that time, I held back a lot.<br />
…Still, the isolation center was a little excessive.<br />
I couldn’t try out even once the latex mattress that I barely bought, and it just burned up.<br />
Latex matress? Should I buy you one.<br />
I’m talking about Yoon Kyeongsoo.<br />
I was thinking of applying the keyword and keeping him tied.<br />
Ah, that guy.<br />
The tip of a long finger tapped the steering wheel.  </p>
<p>There’s something I heard from Hunter Riette.<br />
Riette? What did she say.<br />
It wasn’t anything much.<br />
There’s no evidence for the isolation center case, so it’s okay.<br />
It’s just that I excessively took action.<br />
That little brother said that he did things that would be minorly rebuked.<br />
The actual big matters weren’t on purpose, but maybe rather because of that, it seemed like the response came faster.<br />
Since they seriously added a false charge and tried to bring down pressure.<br />
Since, if they first tightened around Han Yoohyun’s neck, it would be easier to touch his brother, me.  </p>
<p>Even so, there’s a high possibility that deliberately lowering your reputation will become bad in the long term.<br />
And it’ll be hard for me to quietly watch, too.<br />
So let’s end it cleanly.<br />
At my continuing opinion, Yoohyun frowned hard.<br />
Let’s go home.<br />
I’ll let you loose in a week.<br />
Hey, wait!And it was really very difficult to persuade my brother.<br />
There was filming equipment spread around the rooftop garden.<br />
At the center of many people’s gazes, I petted Peace as if nervous.<br />
The male and female entertainers who were sitting on the other side sent me smiles.  </p>
<p>It was really a cool flight.<br />
-Kkyaa! Maybe she had understood the words praising her, because Blue triumphantly flapped her wings.<br />
Then they tossed several questions to me.<br />
When I replied while being reasonably awkward, various exclamations poured over.<br />
It was for the broadcast, but the praise was excessive.<br />
It was just then.<br />
Along with a slight disturbance, the camera turned toward, not us, but the trail connecting to this side.<br />
When I turned my head, I saw a tall and lean young man walking over.<br />
It was Yoohyun.<br />
When he met my eyes, he gave a most refreshing smile.<br />
Whoever’s younger brother he was, he sure was handsome.  </p>
<p>It looks like I arrived too early.<br />
I didn’t know you were still filming.<br />
com for the best novel reading experience.<br />
It’s a live broadcast, this.<br />
”Advertisements.<br />
Really?Yoohyun’s eyes became round as if he didn’t know.<br />
Then the two entertainers didn’t know what to do and asked if it was okay if he came out on screen like this.<br />
The Haeyeon Guild Leader said of course it was okay and smiled beautifully .  </p>
<p>It looks like the two of you are really close.<br />
Since it’s just the two of us as a family.<br />
And he is a younger brother to be incredibly proud of.<br />
His only flaw is that he worries too much about me.<br />
What’s wrong with worrying about you, hyung.<br />
Still, you hearing bad things because of me is…Purposely trailing off, I stared at Yoohyun.<br />
It wasn’t hard to put on a sorry expression.<br />
When I mumbled and let out a sigh, tossing the bait that ‘it is all my fault’, the male entertainer quickly took it, asking what was the matter.  </p>
<p>com That was all because my brother was worrying about me so much.<br />
Since my stat was F-Rank, not any different from an ordinary person.<br />
I spoke, emphasizing the close-to-ordinary-person hyung.<br />
My younger brother was this good.<br />
He was S-Rank, but he defended his weak hyung.<br />
Our relationship was extremely good.  </p>
<p>If I was a little stronger, there would not have been cause for bad talk to come out.<br />
It is my fault.<br />
Don’t talk like that, hyung.<br />
I’m okay.<br />
It was true, but it felt a little cringy to converse like this in front of the camera.<br />
The two entertainers had extremely moved expressions.<br />
If they were this close in distance, they should be feeling pressure from Yoohyun, but they didn’t show it at all.<br />
They really were pros.<br />
In the middle of a good atmosphere, another uninvited quest appeared again.<br />
It was Song Taewon.  </p>
<p>Hunter Han Yoojin.<br />
You will be arrested for inciting harm to Jeon Junhwan and 8 others, as well as violation of the dungeon gate special law.<br />

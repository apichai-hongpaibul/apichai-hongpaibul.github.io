    <h1 id="the-s-classes-that-i-raised-4">The S-Classes That I Raised 4.</h1>
<p>&lt; My Dongsaeng is… (2) .  </p>
<p>Then, excuse me.<br />
The man with the Awakened People appraisal skill said, coming towards me.<br />
I also wanted to look at the status windows of the people here, but if I used Seed-Leaf now, it would probably be noticeable.<br />
I was receiving the attention of S-Ranks.<br />
If I turned my eyes toward the air, I would immediately be grabbed at the back of my neck for doing something suspicious.<br />
-Keureureu Peace, who was quietly in my arms, abruptly bared his canines.<br />
Soon after, the appraiser stepped back and spoke.  </p>
<p>Average stat F-Rank, the Agility Up and Mental Up skills are both E-Rank.<br />
Did it feel the appraisal skill being used? It’s sharp.<br />
The Hanshin Guild Leader said with admiration.<br />
Hanshin Guild Leader, Bak Mingyu.<br />
He was an S-Rank Hunter specialized in defense and I think exactly thirty this year.<br />
He was originally an ordinary office worker, and was an easygoing man with a weak presence among the country’s S-Ranks.<br />
Hanshin Guild as a whole also didn’t stand out significantly and was an easy high rank.<br />
com for a better experience On a particular note, he had a bad relationship with Kim Sunghan.<br />
Specifically, Bak Mingyu one-sidedly regarded Kim Sunghan as a nuisance.<br />
Had he instinctively recognized Kim Sunghan’s talent? Since, if Kim Sunghan became an S-Rank, the premium of being the country’s sole defense-specialized S-Rank Hunter would fall.  </p>
<p>A still immature thing at a C-Rank level? Hansoo-ssi, try using your skill again.<br />
The Breaker Guild Leader said to the appraiser.<br />
She waved him over a while ago too; did she bring over the appraiser? Or he might be a Breaker Guild member.<br />
One of the 3 big guilds, Breaker.<br />
That guild leader was the country’s sole female S-Rank Hunter Moon Hyuna.<br />
Though she wasn’t the sole one anymore.<br />
She was in her late twenties, her previous occupation used to be a tennis player, and her main weapon was a big spear so she had the most interest in a familiar.<br />
The country’s guild with the most familiars currently was Breaker, and 2 years later, they had spent a fortune on buying a high rank familiar from overseas.<br />
-Kyaang! When the appraiser used his skill again, Peace howled loudly.<br />
This time, the distance was even further so was he really detecting it?.<br />
It’s okay, Peace.<br />
com for the best novel reading experience While soothing the agitated Peace, the gazes toward us became obviously heated.  </p>
<p>This must be true.<br />
The Hunter Association Head admired, surprised.  </p>
<p>If it’s a Horned Flame Lion, it’d be an S-Rank dungeon boss rank, right?Moon Hyuna asked, looking at Yoohyun.<br />
He was 8 years your junior, but he was a guild leader and S-Rank like you, so why were you dropping the honorifics?.<br />
It was not a singular entity, but three adults, excluding the juvenile.<br />
The total abilities were less than a singular boss but they were definitely at the level of an S-Rank.<br />
Since the first attack was two months ago, the second attack must be in a month.<br />
How’s this, young master[1.<br />
Giving it to us if another juvenile appears.<br />
A trade for an highest grade juvenile familiar with Cold Resistance is possible.<br />
Yoohyun smiled softly and said.<br />
Moon Hyuna also raised the tips of her mouth back at him.<br />
Speaking of, you said that the lovely kid hoobae-nim’s 10-level skill was ice-affiliated.<br />
I wonder exactly what kind of skill it is.<br />
I’m curious.<br />
Hunter Bak Yerim asked to relay that excessive interest is burdensome.<br />
It’s being friendly between the sole two women S-Rank Hunters in the country.<br />
And it would be more comfortable for Yerim-yang to have a guild leader of the same gender.<br />
Of course, I’m not saying I’ll ignore the contract and snatch her away.<br />
3 years is quick.<br />
Then she smiled.<br />
Wow, she was really an unpleasant woman.<br />
Of course, it was up to Yerim for whichever guild she contracted with 3 years later, and approaching ahead to time and coaxing didn’t contradict business ethics.<br />
Still, I didn’t like it.<br />
Don’t slight my younger brother, and treat each other respectfully.  </p>
<p>I heard that Haeyeon has already purchased several baby monsters; are you not being excessively greedy?MKC’s guild leader Choi Sukwon said.<br />
Why was that guy fighting now.<br />
Choi Sukwon’s previous occupation was a soccer player and was even the captain of the national team.<br />
I had liked him too but seeing him now, he was terrible.<br />
Still, since there were honorifics, plus 1 point.  </p>
<p>It seems that the news was quick, despite that they have not arrived in the country yet.<br />
Did you think I would not know even though even the intention to purchase was revealed publicly? Seven high ranks and one highest rank.<br />
It seems like you swept up and gathered all of them.<br />
Choi Sukwon said, slightly agitated.<br />
Eight of them? Yoohyun, were you thinking of wringing out this hyung to death? Though of course, he probably wouldn’t be giving them to me at once.<br />
Anyways, I didn’t know that a new highest rank monster would appear already.<br />
Was it thanks to bad stock?.<br />
It is possible to trade a highest rank juvenile with a highest rank with Cold Resistance, or ten high rank juveniles including a high rank with Cold Resistance.<br />
Please contact me any time.<br />
Yoohyun said leisurely.<br />
It meant that there wasn’t a highest rank with Cold Resistance among the highest rank monsters bought this time.<br />
I was wondering what kind of guy it would be.  </p>
<p>It seems like Haeyeon’s young master is getting quite a lot of profit due to his hyung-nim.<br />
Moon Hyuna beamed as she stood from her seat.<br />
At her steps coming towards me, Yoohyun’s easygoing expression hardened slightly.<br />
Don’t let it show, punk.<br />
Stay there quietly.  </p>
<p>It seems we’ve kept a precious person standing up for too long a time.<br />
Here, here, please sit.<br />
com Moon Hyuna said, personally pulling out a chair.<br />
The smiling face really was pretty at least.<br />
Even her figure was perfect and she was an impressive beauty, but her height was also impressively tall.<br />
Even with a glance, it seemed like it was over 180.<br />
This was why I hated stat S-Ranks.<br />
Would Yerim also grow bigger than me? It was sad.  </p>
<p>Thank you.<br />
When I obediently sat in the chair, Moon Hyuna tilted her upper body towards me.<br />
The ratio was good so I didn’t know when I was looking at the TV, but it seemed like her build was better than mine too.<br />
Before the regression, I had built up my body a little too, but now… I was just an F-Rank that had gone into a dungeon exactly once.  </p>
<p>To think that Haeyeon’s young master’s hyung, the super rookie’s guardian, is even raising a cute cat.<br />
If I took Han Yoojin-ssi would they all come along.<br />
Would it be so?I smiled back and replied.  </p>
<p>I am a single item without a giveaway or a gift.<br />
com for the best novel reading experience.<br />
I am sorry but I am not for sale.<br />
Saying so, I looked around slightly.<br />
I checked Yoohyun because I was worried but he wasn’t looking this way at all.<br />
That’s right, if you can’t manage your expression, just don’t look.  </p>
<p>Even for your brother?Long fingers touched my neck.<br />
Peace, who was lying down on my lap, raised his eyes.<br />
Yoohyun’s head turned this way and he met my eyes.<br />
It would be okay to say it clearly while I was at it.  </p>
<p>There is an exception to the no sale.<br />
But.<br />
But.<br />
I said that I would make an exception if he becomes the country’s best.<br />
That’s fun.<br />
com Moon Hyuna laughed in a low tone.  </p>
<p>Then that means Seseong Guild could buy you right away?At her words, I moved my gaze.<br />
To the man who hadn’t said anything as of yet.<br />
Seseong[2 Guild Leader Sung Hyunjae.<br />
Of course the guild, but the man himself was also the Hunter called the country’s strongest.<br />
He was looking at me with slight interest.<br />
Since it seemed like they wanted an answer, I gave them one.  </p>
<p>Being the country’s best is a discount for my younger brother.<br />
I wore a smile and continued.  </p>
<p>For others, they would have to be about the world’s best for me to recognize them and make an exception.<br />
com Moon Hyuna yelled cheerfully.<br />
Stop beating my shoulder, this woman.<br />
It hurts.<br />
Peace was also baring his teeth.  </p>
<p>Like dongsaeng, like hyung, it reminds me of that time an eighteen-year-old kid ran around saying he would make his own guild.<br />
Still, maybe because he’s acting his age, the hyung is a lot milder than the dongsaeng.<br />
……I mean, what was wrong with my younger brother? He should be the mildest out of the people gathered here; the criticism was too harsh.  </p>
<p>My younger brother is milder than I am.<br />
I couldn’t bear it and said something.<br />
Moon Hyuna widened her eyes exaggeratedly.  </p>
<p>Are you sincere about that joke.<br />
Of course, I am sincere-.<br />
Oh my god, hyung-nim! So cute!Then she laughed uproariously.<br />
com ‘…Wait.<br />
’ The other people were laughing too.<br />
Except for Yoohyun, who was sitting down acting haughty.<br />
On top of that, even the Seseong Guild Leader laughed as if dumbfounded.<br />
These people wouldn’t be free enough to put me up as the target of a hidden camera…… Yoo-Yoohyun? Your reputation seemed a little weird…….<br />
Wow, that crazy bastard, because it’s in front of his hyung-nim, acting innoce-.<br />
Breaker Guild Leader.<br />
Yoohyun cut off Moon Hyuna’s words.  </p>
<p>It seems that your words are a little harsh.<br />
Really crazy! No wonder, you’re seriously polite today! I was wondering if you’ve suddenly matured, ahaha-.<br />
Then she started to laugh again.<br />
She seemed like she would actually roll on the floor.<br />
com ‘Acting innocent?’ What nonsense was that? Our Yoohyun was good and well-behaved since he was young.<br />
He listened well and didn’t really do anything to make me worry.<br />
Of course, even I knew that you couldn’t continue being good and well-behaved in order to become a guild leader at a young age.<br />
Still, ‘crazy bastard’ was too harsh.  </p>
<p>Being friendly between brothers is something good.<br />
The Hanshin Guild Leader said.<br />
Was that something you say after being the second loudest to laugh? Shit, you guys were crazy so my brother must have acted so to match his opponents.<br />
It was obvious they bothered him to death saying that a young kid didn’t know to bend.<br />
Just looking at how Yoohyun worried over my safety, they were bastards with pitch black hearts; you should shoot hungry wolves, not shake a piece of foxtail grass.  </p>
<p>Geez, hyung-nim! That’s right, it’s good to treat him well.<br />
He became a good younger brother.<br />
Moon Hyuna, who was hunched over at the waist, raised her body and said.<br />
I really hated this woman.  </p>
<p>Yes.<br />
I think it is better that way.<br />
Instead of being affiliated to one place, drawing back one step and doing business impartially in a familiar production, administrative position would be good also for various guilds.<br />
But wouldn’t you actually be affiliated to Haeyeon?The MKC Guild Leader asked, slightly wrinkling his forehead.  </p>
<p>We are collaboration partners to a certain extent.<br />
It is hard for me to handle alone so needing help is inevitable.<br />
If you consider it like that, everyone here is also being treated preferentially like Haeyeon is, through the reward of the negotiation.<br />
Of course within the country, but there are many guilds overseas that need familiars.<br />
You have received the chance to become a lot more advantaged than them.<br />
From now on, the five guilds gathered here would be able to cement their superiority over, of course the country’s, but also other guilds overseas.<br />
One of the conditions for the negotiation was to give each of the five, the maximum number I could raise, to each of them.<br />
Of course they could make S-Rank attack teams with a familiar faster than others, and it was possible to do business with other guilds with an empty seat.<br />
It was a good condition, enough to make Suk Simyeong complain that we were being too good to them.  </p>
<p>Also, my value is at its peak right now and will continue to fall from now on, so you do not need to worry about my relationship with Haeyeon.<br />
As you know, high rank, highest rank familiars are not expendables.<br />
I didn’t tell them how long the lifespan of a monster was.<br />
It really wasn’t short at all.<br />
Even low rank monsters reared for research use were fine for over seven years, so the probability was high that lifespans for high ranks were longer.<br />
com for a better experience So even after just four to five years, people who would come looking for me would start to decrease.<br />
The demand wouldn’t completely disappear, but it would work with just providing three to four a year.<br />
And if an S-Rank or higher tamer or a similar skill holder appeared, then my work would end even faster.  </p>
<p>It is my dream to retire about halfway in several years and live leisurely, as the requests for rearing decreases.<br />
This was sincerity without a single lie.<br />
I should live managing my building while holding one baby monster in my arms.<br />
Ah, just thinking about it was good.<br />
It was a perfect life.<br />
It would be perfect if I got a lover who wasn’t affected by the keyword or thought of a neighbor oppa as a caregiver.  </p>
<p>Hyung-nim speaks well.<br />
Then let’s return to the subject and finish adjusting the contract.<br />
Moon Hyuna returned to her seat and smiled.<br />
Of course the framework, but even the meat of the negotiation items were already there so the adjustment went smoothly.<br />
The main points of the negotiation items were as follows.<br />
The five guilds would guarantee my and my building’s safety.<br />
com I would receive the five guilds’ rearing commissions preferentially.<br />
But, the number acquired in advance for each guild would be limited to 1 per 2 months.<br />
The construction of the building that would contain the rearing facilities would be by the investments of the four guilds, with Haeyeon exempted.<br />
The ownership of the completed building would be mine.<br />
There were small matters outside of that but the important things were those four.<br />
And the most advantageous part for me was ‘my building’s safety would be guaranteed’ – this part right here.<br />
Of course, it was limited to this one place that would be built and a time period was also set.<br />
But there was no clause that said only I could enter.<br />
In other words, it meant that whether it was Yoo Myeongwoo or Suk Hayan or anyone else, if I, the building owner, received them, they could receive the protection from the highest ranked five guilds of the country .<br />
Of course Yoohyun, but the other guild leaders too probably wouldn’t even dream of the things I would start.<br />
Still, if I gave them priority like with the familiar rearing, then it definitely wouldn’t be a loss for them either.<br />
As for me, I just had to relax and receive rent.<br />
com Like that, we stamped the contract and various questions about Peace were exchanged a little, and it quickly ended.<br />
There weren’t exactly any tough questions, so of course the guild leaders and even the Association Head were subtly friendly to me.<br />
Advertisements Well, it was a situation to be friendly and treating me well wasn’t something bad.<br />
But it was a bit uncomfortable.<br />
Especially Moon Hyuna’s gaze that was saying I was so extremely cute.<br />
If you took out the regression, I was younger, but she was looking at me like she was treating me like some youngest little sibling.<br />
Since she would provide a lot of money for building the building, I should bear it.  </p>
<p>Thanks to hyung-nim, I had fun for the first time in a while.<br />
Moon Hyuna left the room while throwing me a wink.<br />
Ah, yes.<br />
Since you were saying it was so, it was quite worthwhile.<br />
Even though I didn’t do much, I was tired.  </p>
<p>Peace, stop biting the chair and come down.<br />
Did he get an interest in breaking furniture? That chair should be expensive.<br />
com I was going to go bring him over myself when someone blocked my path.<br />
It was the Seseong Guild Leader, Sung Hyunjae.  </p>
<p>I’ll keep the exception condition in mind.<br />
He said, merrily.<br />
What exception… no, wait.<br />
Please just forget it.  </p>
<p>Then, I’ll see you again soon.<br />
He lightly patted my shoulder and passed me.<br />
Ah, what.<br />
It wasn’t like it was easy to become the world’s best guild, and even 5 years later, he couldn’t.<br />
I probably wouldn’t need to worry about it.<br />
Anyways, it was over.<br />
[1 used to call a young unmarried nobleman back in the old days.<br />
Also a respectful way of calling ‘unmarried younger brother of one’s husband’ which is how it’s used solely nowadays since there aren’t any noblemen in current society.<br />
But it’s used as the former meaning here, obviously.<br />
[2 another name for jupiter (the planet), the more common name is 목성 (mohk-sung).  </p>

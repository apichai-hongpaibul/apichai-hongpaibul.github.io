    <h1 id="the-s-classes-that-i-raised-78">The S-Classes That I Raised-78.</h1>
<p>&lt; Hatchling Class Teacher (5) .  </p>
<p>It’s a pity that camera phones don’t work in a dungeon.<br />
Yerim said, placing me down.<br />
What now about camera phones? Did she want to take a picture since it was the first SS-Rank monster that appeared? Because she flew over slowly in case I couldn’t handle it, the other four had already arrived at the Babar’s back.<br />
The large back that was made up of rocks barely had any tremors and it really felt like we had gone up to a mountainside.  </p>
<p>There really isn’t any reaction?Moon Hyuna said, hitting the ground with the tip of her foot.  </p>
<p>Because it is the same as flies landing on top of padding.<br />
Even so, please do not immediately poke it with a spear.<br />
At my words, Moon Hyuna stopped raising her spear and lowered it.<br />
Anyways, you couldn’t be careless.  </p>
<p>Where is Kim Sunghan-ssi?The toad’s back was so wide that it was hard to search below.<br />
Yerim floated up a bit and looked around before answering.<br />
com for a better experience.<br />
Seeing how he’s taking the bow and going further away, it seems he has already shot it.<br />
Really? Then…Even if it felt unnatural, I had to apply the keyword to Moon Hyuna.<br />
The Teacher skill said that the higher the target’s abilities, the bigger the burden could be.<br />
But there were five only S-Ranks, here.<br />
So it would be safer to lessen the burden through the keyword application.  </p>
<p>Hyuna-ssi, please take good care of our Peace.<br />
He does not have experience as a kiseungsu, and this is basically his first dungeon.<br />
I said to Moon Hyuna, going towards her.<br />
I actually was worried.<br />
I didn’t know he would have to go up against a monster stronger than him this fast.  </p>
<p>Don’t worry, this kid’s dad.<br />
There’ll be no problem as long as Peace follows well.<br />
Even your words are reliable.<br />
When I purposely put on a forced smile that showed that it was feigned, Moon Hyuna’s face looked displeased, as expected.<br />
If you’re uneasy, then openly say that you’re uneasy.<br />
Anyways, hyung-nim doesn’t trust only me.<br />
…Does it show that much?I continued, sheepishly.  </p>
<p>Truthfully, I do feel uneasy.<br />
But it is definitely not that I cannot trust Hyuna-ssi.<br />
Rather, you are reliable, and I am grateful.<br />
I worried quite a lot before coming into the dungeon.<br />
You know as well, that all of you are people that I cannot go up against.<br />
If I was a normal stat F without fear resistance, I might have gotten stomach cramps from the stress by now.  </p>
<p>For Haeyeon Guild, I know them well and spend time with them normally, so I can be relieved, but I could not help but wonder if the other two people would be okay, with the way I am.<br />
But, Hyuna-ssi was much kinder than I expected, and listened to my opinions well, so I could quickly be at ease.<br />
If I have carelessly treated you too casually, and possibly offended you, then I apologize.<br />
Ah, was there anything that went so far as being offensive? Treat me casually.<br />
It’s okay.<br />
She smiled and stretched out a hand to mess up my hair.<br />
If you counted before the regression, I was older, though.  </p>
<p>If you really are grateful, then lend me the gryphon often.<br />
That is a little difficult.<br />
Instead, I will give you my earnest feelings.<br />
I love you, Moon Hyuna-ssi.<br />
Please take care of me from now on.<br />
I’m a little sad since it’s just your feelings.<br />
But I’ll overlook it since it’s hyung-nim.<br />
Then her expression became a little strange.  </p>
<p>Hyung-nim scolding me, surprisingly wasn’t unpleasant.<br />
Was it because I thought of my sunbae-nim? You do seem a bit similar.<br />
When she said ‘sunbae-nim’, I thought that it must’ve worked without me having to check the status window.<br />
She was probably talking about a sunbae while she was an athlete, or possibly in a sports club at school.<br />
It was highly likely it was a female sunbae-nim, but if it was that level, it wasn’t bad.<br />
As long as it wasn’t ‘mother’.<br />
Sunbae-nim whose name I don’t know, thank you for looking after Moon Hyuna-ssi well.<br />
After soothing Peace, asking him to keep in sync with Moon Hyuna just this once, I used the My Brat growth buff on Yoohyun.<br />
After catching the SS-Rank monster and going out, he would quickly go into an S-Rank dungeon, so using it on him now was perfect.  </p>
<p>I will use a skill starting from now.<br />
As soon as I spoke, the gazes gathered on me.<br />
They were so focused on me that it was to the point of feeling a little burdened.<br />
com for a better experience.<br />
The skill I earned this morning is a type of chain of command special skill.<br />
This is my first time using it, so I cannot know the specifics of the effect yet, but according to the explanation window, it will assist the people the skill is applied to, in closely cooperating.<br />
The most important thing right now is a precise and fast connection between each skill, so I think it will be of help.<br />
A skill appeared this morning.<br />
Yeah.<br />
It’s probably the one I didn’t get at 20 levels, and appeared because the conditions were achieved.<br />
Wouldn’t it have to do with several S-Rank Hunters gathered together?Specifically, I thought it was the 10 level skill, but externally, it became that my 10 level skill was the magic beast rearing, so let’s put it as the 20 level.<br />
At any rate, the 20 level skill didn’t appear either.  </p>
<p>It seems like ahjussi really doesn’t have even a little bit of a combat-related aptitude.<br />
Yerim said something agonizing.<br />
Alright, anyways I was stat F-Rank.<br />
Even if there was a good attack skill, even if the effect was doubled, in the eyes of the people here, at the most it would seem like a mouse becoming a cat.<br />
A special skill that was less affected by stat was better.<br />
I told them the precaution that they shouldn’t reject it, and then used the skill on Yoohyun first.<br />
Along with the skill being applied, I ‘understood’ Han Yoohyun’s movements.<br />
That also included one foot forward, up to his strength’s adjustment.<br />
Han Yoohyun’s mouth opened.<br />
No, it was going to open.<br />
I don’t really feel anything yet.<br />
What about hyung?Instead of replying, I used the skill on Yerim too.<br />
When I did, even without looking at the bright gaze my way, I could feel it.<br />
Yoohyun was also looking at me.<br />
If you included mine, I could sense three gazes.<br />
‘Was this why the Mental stat was necessary?’ It was dizzying, but maybe because of the skill compensation, or possibly the keyword compensation, it was still okay.<br />
But it seemed like it would be hard to handle if the number increased.<br />
And I could transmit these sensations that I was feeling toward the people the skill was applied to.<br />
Unilaterally, and in both directions, too.  </p>
<p>I’ll start to connect the two people starting now.<br />
Huh? This is interesting?Yerim said, widening her eyes.<br />
Yoohyun also seemed surprised.  </p>
<p>To think that I can feel how the other person will move.<br />
It’ll definitely be the best for working together.<br />
You don’t think it’ll be a hindrance? Like the sensations becoming confusing.<br />
No, not at all.<br />
It’s stably divided, so there won’t be concerns over it mixing.<br />
It seemed like it was different from me.<br />
Could I be acting as a type of filter? Working the user to the bone and increasing the targets’ cooperativity? ‘…It’s being a normal kindergarten teacher.<br />
’ Especially the suffering teacher trying to get the kids to match the dance routine during the school talent show[1 season.<br />
And speaking of, when Yoohyun was in kindergarten, he was in the hatchling class.  </p>
<p>com Like she wanted, I used the skill on Moon Hyuna, and then Peace.<br />
When it became four, I slowly became mentally exhausted.<br />
I was also slightly dizzy.<br />
It seemed like I couldn’t use it for long.  </p>
<p>Yerim!Clang! Moon Hyuna’s giant white spear and Yerim’s Ice Wood spear smacked against each other.<br />
If it was as usual, Yerim would’ve been pushed away in an instant, but the two spears that were clearly different in width and length, like how their owner’s strengths were clearly different, stopped in the middle right as they just touched.<br />
There wasn’t even a little bit of a tremble.<br />
It meant that the two people’s strength distribution was precise enough to give you goosebumps.  </p>
<p>Wow, this works in one go.<br />
It really does! Ahjussi, can’t you just go around the dungeon with me?Are you trying to kill me? Now only Sung Hyunjae was left.<br />
The person without the keyword applied and with the best abilities among the people here.<br />
Ah, I really didn’t think I would be able to handle it.<br />
com for the best novel reading experience ‘He’s the most important last blow so it’s not like I can just not use it on him.<br />
’ It was the Babar that wouldn’t have much on a reaction up to Yoohyun.<br />
But it was obvious that once Moon Hyuna broke the skin, it would immediately try to recover and use its regeneration skill.  </p>
<p>Is there some problem?Sun Hyunjae, who had come up behind me when I wasn’t noticing, asked.<br />
He was asking why I wasn’t using the skill on him.  </p>
<p>Let me drink a potion first.<br />
I still had more than half of mana left, but just in case, I should fill it up.<br />
I took out the disgusting apple-flavored potion and gulped it down.<br />
I had inquired about custom potions at the Association, but they said special treatment was impossible.<br />
Inflexible people.<br />
Then I used the skill.<br />
‘……It’s endurable.<br />
’ Compared to someone the keyword was applied to, the sense of burden that I felt was definitely bigger.<br />
But still, about 1.<br />
How interesting.<br />
In an instant, along with the feeling of my entire body roughly trembling, my vision grew dizzy.<br />
As the strength left my legs, Sung Hyunjae grabbed my arm and helped me stay up.<br />
Fuck, Sung Hyunjae, son of a bitch…….<br />
Didn’t I say, not to reject it.<br />
I just tried lightly bothering it, though.<br />
He replied with a shameless face.<br />
If I said not to do it, then don’t do it.<br />
Did the burden being bigger for people the keyword isn’t applied to, include this? The other people, even Moon Hyuna, were all well-behaved, but just this bastard was pulling crap.  </p>
<p>Is there something wrong?Yoohyun came over, glaring at Sung Hyunjae, the hand that was holding my arm.<br />
Anyways, Sung Hyunjae, this damn bastard.<br />
He was the oldest person here and yet he was stirring up trouble.  </p>
<p>It’s nothing.<br />
I just got a little dizzy because the number of skill targets increased.<br />
You’re really okay.<br />
I’m fine.<br />
If the crooked person next to me just stayed still, it was endurable.<br />
Just then, Sung Hyunjae, who had been taking off his coat, hung it over my shoulders.  </p>
<p>It has an S-Rank flame resistance, so wear it.<br />
Since young master’s skill will have the biggest impact.<br />
The defense power is usable, too.<br />
I have the bracelet, so I am okay.<br />
If I were you, I wouldn’t use it until the success of the hunt was certain, but am I wrong?He was correct.<br />
Still, why didn’t you say it while Yoohyun wasn’t here? Look at him, his eyes were getting fierce again.  </p>
<p>Hyung.<br />
I mean, if need be, I have the shielding earring, and I can only use it once… I’ll wear the coat.<br />
com for a better experience I slowly slipped my arms into the sleeves.<br />
The loose width and the sleeves that covered my hands shrunk to fit me perfectly.<br />
‘I want to take it and bolt.<br />
’ If he didn’t have this, later during the ranking competitions, Yoohyun would suffer less.<br />
It probably wouldn’t work if I acted crazy and stuck it in my inventory.  </p>
<p>I’ll use the bracelet matching the timing, so don’t worry.<br />
That little brother turned around with a still sullen face.<br />
Once we got out of the dungeon, I should somehow pacify him; like that, he’d burst again.<br />
Just then, I felt Yerim spreading out Shadowless Day.  </p>
<p>The preparations are all ready!Right afterwards, Sung Hyunjae held me with one arm.<br />
It was impossible for me to hang on during battle with my arm strength, so there was no choice, but still, it was upsetting.<br />
I was luggage.<br />
Just Luggage A.<br />
com for a better experience.<br />
I will share the skill, so please don’t take it off.<br />
I used One More as a Freebie(S), the skill that let me share an S-Rank and under skill title with somebody else through contact, with Sung Hyunaje as the target.<br />
The skill to be shared was Veteran F-Rank(S).<br />
It was the attack skill effect doubling title.<br />
Sung Hyunjae took out the Refined Seeker’s Chains from his inventory.<br />
The gold chains the width of a finger writhed like snakes swimming in the air and circled the surroundings.<br />
The powerful electric energy it carried occasionally sparked and sparkled.<br />
Right now, my gaze wasn’t necessary, so I closed my eyes.<br />
And I wanted to decrease at least one part of the data pushing through.<br />
A powerful mana field was spread over the center of the Babar’s back neck that was like a cliff.<br />
Shadowless Day.<br />
Bak Yerim was floating over the domain that she was ruling.<br />
She was always self-confident like that.<br />
Even in front of an opponent that she couldn’t properly hurt with her power, she was having fun.<br />
The Ice Wood Spear’s ice attribute reinforcement skill was evoked.<br />
A powerful chill that would even freeze breaths that haven’t been breathed out yet, started to overflow.<br />
If she hadn’t raised her levels yesterday and gotten the cold resistance, the user also could’ve suffered damage.<br />
com Sareureuk Cold Sigh covered the area like a veil.<br />
The fog that was originally white was tinged with vivid blue from the Mana that was pulled up as much as possible and the ice attribute reinforcement.<br />
Above that.<br />
Swaaa-! Frozen rain poured down.<br />
The range was narrowed as much as possible, and instead of rain, ice fog that was thick as spear blades whirled around and struck down.<br />
Jjaak- Jjuuuk! The temperature that rapidly went down.<br />
Without time to check the results she created, Yerim’s body disappeared.<br />
com for the best novel reading experience Almost at the same time as that, immediately swallowing up the place where Yerim was- Kwagwagwagwa! Was a blaze pouring out like a furious wave.<br />
The frozen rock wall melted in an instant.<br />
It heated up into a bright red.<br />
The color of the flames greedily gnawing away above that, quickly deepened.<br />
From red-purple to dark purple, and finally a complete black.<br />
Thanks to the flame resistance, I didn’t feel any heat, but it was an extremely high temperature that would block your breath with just the conveyed data.  </p>
<p>Isn’t now just right?!Even though the risk data that she wouldn’t be able to handle it was sent, Moon Hyuna was impatient over not being able to rush in.<br />
That personality.<br />
Of course, it was probably the softest now, but if the spearman that had to break it couldn’t bring out her strength due to burns, she would be useless.<br />
com The amount that Moon Hyuna could handle.<br />
A certain level of damage was allowed.<br />
She was sturdy enough, so there was no need to wait long.<br />
Only a short moment was needed.<br />
Charging speed, distance, the remaining time for the flames, I felt a little like I was going to throw up.<br />
My head was already a mess.<br />
Right now.<br />
Kkadeudeuk- Strength went into Peace’s four legs.<br />
The claws that came out scratched the ground.<br />
At the same time the jockey and kiseungsu who were completely in tune powerfully kicked off the ground, I used the bracelet’s skill.<br />
In order for Sung Hyunjae to pour out electric shocks right after the tip of Moon Hyuna’s spear broke the skin, he had to move right now too.<br />
Without having to speak outloud, Sung Hyunjae’s feet moved.<br />
com I heard an ear-piercing explosive sound.<br />
As debris sprayed out, the end of the spear dug into the Babar’s skin like a giant drill, with that enormous vigor.<br />
Her clothes were burned and her hands and face were partly festered red, but Moon Hyuna was smiling.<br />
She was really excited.<br />
Opposite to her, -Gureureuk The giant toad finally reacted.<br />
As if taken aback, it let out a sound like a mountain rumbling and moved its body.<br />
The half-broken castle was completely collapsed down.<br />
It would probably use the regeneration soon, but it was already too late.<br />
The flesh was exposed.<br />
The flesh that was covered in dark green bodily fluid that had spurted out from the fierce spear piercing even a thick vein.<br />
Moon Hyuna and Peace quickly moved back without regret.<br />
With precise timing, Sung Hyunjae finished the preparation.<br />
com Flew like arrows and drove into the Babar’s flesh.<br />
Pale lights flashed, and painted the view bright white.<br />
The smell of meat burning.<br />
Debris started to fly again.<br />
The enormously destructive electric shock didn’t relent and and poured down like a deluge.<br />
The thick flesh that was hard to pierce with normal physical force, burned and boiled up, and its surroundings melted stickily.<br />
The white bone was briefly exposed, and then even that also burned black.<br />
As if to gobble up the giant body altogether, the electric current spread in one breath.<br />
-Goouuung! The Babar screamed as it twisted its body.<br />
It was mixed with the sound of something collapsing and the sound of the ground reverberating.<br />
At the enormous build floundering, even the air trembled.<br />
Advertisements But that struggle didn’t last long.<br />
com for a better experience -Gooooong! Along with the loud roar of the death throes, the mountain collapsed down.<br />
The skin that was firmly stuck to the Babar’s entire body lost its cohesiveness and fell off.<br />
It was literally a landslide.<br />
After checking that everyone had safely avoided the boulders falling like rain, I turned off the Teacher skill.<br />
I was taken aback by my vision growing dark in an instant, and lifted up my eyelids.<br />
But I couldn’t hold out for long and closed them again.<br />
It seemed like the reward window had popped up, but I didn’t even have the energy to check.<br />
‘I feel like I’m going to die, really.<br />
’ It was a feeling like my soul was plucked out and put into a juicer and squeezed to the end.  </p>
<p>…I will close my eyes a little, so please do not fight.<br />
Take the kids and end the dungeon attack well, as benefiting the eldest, please.<br />
I was uneasy, but I fell asleep as if passing out.  </p>

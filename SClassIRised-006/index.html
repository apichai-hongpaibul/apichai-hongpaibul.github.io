    <h1 id="the-s-classes-that-i-raised-6">The S-Classes That I Raised-6.</h1>
<p>By the time the world was getting used to dungeons, Hunters had become a famous money-making profession.<br />
Not even mentioning S-Levels, even B-Levels could make whopping amounts of money.<br />
The annual income of C-Levels is also high.<br />
Even in D-Levels, you could make 100 million won.<br />
Below, not only the E-Levels, but also for F-Levels, if there is adequate combat aptitude, the income would be better than small and medium sized business men.<br />
Mana Stones from dungeons have become a new source of energy, and also by-products for the development of new medicines and useful new materials.<br />
In addition, magic and science were combined and various new technologies have been created.<br />
Is this world, Han Yuhyun who is all, handsome, and famous for his quickly developing Haeyeon Guild, do I need to explain any further? He is barely twenty years old, young and promising.<br />
(??: 창창하다 못해 어리다) Even with just one interview, viewers’ ratings were several times higher, and magazines with photos sold out instantly.<br />
‘If it’s let slip that he’s a family man, the reaction is going to be explosive.<br />
’ I muttered inwardly, looking at Yuhyun’s back as he is pulling out a pot from the spacious induction kitchen.<br />
Of course, I thought we were going out for dinner.<br />
I never thought that we would be eating homemade cooking in his house.<br />
For your information, Yu-hyun’s house was on the top floor of the Haeyeon Guild building.<br />
It is not widely known for security reasons, but it accounts for half of the floor.<br />
It is a place where people can only enter via filthily expensive mini-portals, and not stairs, elevators, or doors.  </p>
<p>I did not know you were a good cook.<br />
Sitting at the dining table, I watched my brother finishing his cooking and accidentally let that slip.<br />
It’s better now that I’ve been watching what I eat.<br />
What? Why? You’ve got a lot of money.<br />
Not even mentioning the ability to buy anything you want to eat after you’ve Awakened, you’re making enough money to hire a top-notch chef.<br />
He answered my question with some reservations.  </p>
<p>Now I have to detox items, unlike before.<br />
That’s why I feel more comfortable cooking my own food.<br />
Even now, when I go into dungeons, I carry my own dry rations.<br />
Dungeons are the most dangerous place to be.<br />
……detox? You do that?What did I hear? I mean, there were some bastards who put poisons and curses in the food, so I had to cook for myself… was that it?.<br />
……I didn’t know.<br />
In the past, I thought that he was just a lucky, hotshot S-Level Awakening, and that he would only suffer a little after my return.<br />
To think that his life was being threatened, I never could have dreamt that it was such a mess.<br />
For me, Yuhyun was so strong that I couldn’t even look at him.<br />
As soon as he Awakened, he got everyone’s attention and became popular.<br />
I saw only the term.<br />
S-Leveland closed my eyes to everything else.<br />
Don’t look like that.<br />
This was the result of my choice.<br />
Yuhyun, who came to the table, said in a soft voice.  </p>
<p>The tall tree catches the wind.<br />
You think it’s nice to have a kid out there trying to make a guild for himself? If you just entered the right guild and made a proper living, you would not have to face such threats on your life.<br />
I couldn’t do what he did.<br />
He laughed at me.  </p>
<p>That’s why I’ve been upset with my relationship with hyung all this time.<br />
It is also the result of my choice to monitor, interfere with, and bind hyung in the name of protection.<br />
I made my guild, knowing that they would touch my only blood related relative.<br />
(??: 그놈들이 하나뿐인 혈육에 손 댈 거라는 사실을 알면서도 나는 내 길드를 만들었어.<br />
).<br />
……Why did you not tell me.<br />
At first I didn’t want to burden you… and later I thought you wouldn’t understand.<br />
…Certainly, if it was before my regression, I would either yell at my brother to let me live on my own or resent him.  </p>
<p>But I was totally wrong.<br />
You were still thinking about me and worried about me like when I was a kid.<br />
I misunderstood hyung without knowing it.<br />
I’m sorry.<br />
com Ugh, my conscience hurts.<br />
I was just going to loaf around after my regression.<br />
If you say these things, I feel like crap.  </p>
<p>……I didn’t do much good either.<br />
You were interrupted with everything you tried to do without knowing why.<br />
It’s understandable.<br />
The inside of my chest was itchy.<br />
The warm ticklish feeling became stronger as the younger brother took a bite of the meal.<br />
It was good to go back to the past.<br />
It was the best choice I’ve ever made.  </p>
<p>I roughly understand the situation.<br />
But isn’t it too much for today? You don’t have to do all this to keep me safe.<br />
So far, nothing big has happened.<br />
As soon as I expressed my desire to leave, Yuhyun’s face stiffened up.  </p>
<p>No.<br />
Why? I’ll be careful.<br />
I was okay this morning.<br />
This morning is different from now.<br />
The only reason hyung could have done so much is because I had cut off relationships with you.<br />
It’s illegal to lay a hand on an Unawakened and people would think it’s not worth the risk.<br />
A heavier voice followed.  </p>
<p>But if I command the Haeyeon Guild to take note of hyung’s safety, and ask them to patrol your residence, my enemies will start targeting you.<br />
They’ll already start keeping an eye on you just because I brought you into my house.<br />
Then it’s better to keep pretending to be on bad terms on the outside, right.<br />
You said you were okay with it.<br />
……what?When did I? I don’t have a single memory that allowed him to have me live in captivity.<br />
Yuhyun replied with a cheeky face.<br />
I’m sorry and I love you.<br />
Honestly, it’s my fault and I’m supposed to be responsible for it, but you shouldered it.<br />
That’s as good as permission.<br />
Is, is that how you interpreted it? This kid’s weird, too!.<br />
Don’t be ridiculous! Life in captivity is a no-no.<br />
Just put up with it for three years.<br />
I’ll wipe them out in three years.<br />
Don’t laugh as you say it! And it’s not three years but five years! It took five years! Damn it, the right choice is bullshit.<br />
The heat extended across the back of my neck and my back straightened, but I tried to calm my mind with deep breathing.<br />
The guy in front of me is a S-level awakening before he’s my brother.<br />
That’s a guild that’s experienced many hardships.<br />
Emotionally, you won’t get a scratch.<br />
I could never win with force and this had to be solved through dialogue somehow.  </p>
<p>How can I live in imprisonment for three years? I already get depressed if I stay in the room for only a month.<br />
Even if there were people who were after me, it wouldn’t be hard to make a fuss in broad daylight.<br />
And if you do not mind, I can stick with a guardian.<br />
I can go with Sunghan or something.<br />
Of course I’ll let you out sometimes.<br />
How often?I have arrived here in the present.<br />
I’m sitting with my younger brother, not even my parents.<br />
At my age, my parents wouldn’t even say anything.<br />
How did this happen?.<br />
It depends on the schedule.<br />
If we start hitting the dungeons, we won’t be able to hire A-Levels to protect you.<br />
You can’t leave it to B-Levels.<br />
The bottom line is that all you need is an A-Level with a lot of time.<br />
I opened my mouth with confidence.  </p>
<p>Then you’ll let me go if I get a dedicated A-Level guard.<br />
…you’re going to get an A-level.<br />
Yes.<br />
Yuhyun’s eyes, that were filled with wonder, suddenly turned sharp.  </p>
<p>Hyung, you’ve Awakened.<br />
……huh?H, how did he know? This jerk’s dirty fast on the uptake.  </p>
<p>Even in the morning, you were going to meet a broker, so you must have been Unawakened, so when did you Awaken? Right before you met me? Right after we met? That’s why you gave up on contacting the broker.<br />
Your destination would have been the Hunter’s Association.<br />
…I have nothing to say.<br />
I’m going to lie down.  </p>
<p>I’m afraid the rating is less than D.<br />
You can tell that.<br />
C-Levels or higher would be a little awkward as they are not able to adapt to excessive physical abilities.<br />
Especially if muscle strength exceeds the average B-Level, you would not be able to adapt for three or four days.<br />
You wouldn’t be able to control your strength so you would destroy everything you touch.<br />
I guess so.  </p>
<p>Yeah.<br />
However, the adaptability of S-Levels is high, and it gets better in a day.<br />
Of course, if you have extremely high mental strength or mana, it won’t be noticeable even if it’s above C-Level.<br />
I’m an ordinary F-Level.<br />
Initial skill, special skill? If you are confident that you can get an A-Level, you will be able to know the Awakening Level, Awaken the target, or both.<br />
It should be at least Grade C.<br />
It’s S Level.<br />
I can’t say anything in front of him.<br />
Given that Yoo Hyun’s expression is very shaky, I think it’s better to speak less about it.  </p>
<p>It’s a special Awakening skill, and it’s C-Grade.<br />
I can awaken the Unawakened and roughly know the expected Level of Awakening.<br />
How accurate is it.<br />
It’s usually half and half.<br />
It’s either strong or weak.<br />
I can’t tell you apart from Sunghan.<br />
Perhaps B-Level or less.<br />
There’s a 30-day cooldown per usage.<br />
If it weren’t for the waiting time, it would be Class A.<br />
He nodded at my words.<br />
His face, which had been shadowed, also lit up slightly.  </p>
<p>That’s enough to get caught, but I’m not going to get shot.<br />
(??: 그 정도면 들통 난다 해도 크게 노려지지는 않겠어.<br />
) It would be useful if you could find out more than grade B in advance, but the waiting time is too long.<br />
Even if you find an A-Level or S-Level, there’s no guarantee that you can sign a contract.<br />
The temptation of Awakening cannot be used because there is going to be an Awakening Center.<br />
Awakening Center?I pretended not to know.  </p>
<p>The Awakening Mechanism has been roughly identified, so the construction of the center is about to begin.<br />
It’s the association’s goal to make sure that in the next half year, it would be safe for anyone to Awaken.<br />
Each of the top guilds has already talked about it, and they’ve invested.<br />
I’ve invested too.<br />
That’s great.<br />
The number of Awakenings will increase tremendously.<br />
The official announcement is in four months, so don’t go around talking.<br />
Are you going to let me meet someone to talk to?Instead of answering, the smile came back.<br />
Why don’t you let this madman lock you up in a prison cell?.<br />
Anyway, I’ll find an A-Level to protect me, so just give me a chance.<br />
It wouldn’t be easy once every 30 days.<br />
A-Levels are not common.<br />
But it won’t take three years.<br />
If I’m lucky, you can find it right away.<br />
Of course I don’t need luck.<br />
I already know who’s an A-Level.<br />
Yuhyun’s mouth opened after a while.  </p>
<p>Okay, if you really sign a contract with an A-Level, I’m not going to overprotect you.<br />
They have to have an offensive or a defense ability.<br />
Finally, I was given permission.<br />
He’s such a horrible, strict little brother.<br />
Although there was one more condition, Park Yerim was famous as a combat wizard, so that was no problem.<br />
The problem was the keyword, dammit.  </p>

    <h1 id="the-s-classes-that-i-raised-8">The S-Classes That I Raised-8.</h1>
<p>The money in the gift card was a whopping one billion won.<br />
Wow, I just told you that I needed money and you threw me a billion won.<br />
Is this really possible? Don’t you need to pay gift tax? Are S Classes exempt from gift taxes? Dazed, I put the card away and entered the shopping mall.<br />
The Hunter’s Mall was located from the 3rd to the 6th level of the Hunter’s Association building.<br />
On the 3rd and 4th floor, you can purchase items that are C Class or below, on the 5th floor you could purchase B Class items and on the 6th floor you could purchase A Class items.<br />
S Class items were only sold in auctions.<br />
Since I was sure that I had enough money, I went directly up to the 6th floor.<br />
There were only a few guests on the 6th floor, along with a line of neatly dressed staff standing in a line at regular intervals like mannequins.  </p>
<p>Where are the S Class contracts?When I asked the question to the nearest female employee, she replied with a beautiful and kind smile.  </p>
<p>I’ll show you right away, sir.<br />
Would you please come this way?The employee guided me to a drawing room where the reception room was located, surrounded by glass walls.<br />
I looked around the drawing room and saw that there were a few reception rooms situated in this place.<br />
When I sat down on the sofa, another female employee asked if I wanted a drink.  </p>
<p>Coffee.<br />
com for the best novel reading experience.<br />
Do you have any beans that you like?It’s just a Mac X…… But there was no instant coffee in this place.  </p>
<p>Uh, orange juice please.<br />
They will not ask about the different types of oranges.<br />
Fortunately, the staff only asked if I wanted ice before squeezing the orange straight into an expensive-looking glass.<br />
‘It’s delicious.<br />
’ Was it an expensive orange? While I was sipping juice, a man who looked like he was around his mid to late 30s came over and greeted me with a 90 degree bow.  </p>
<p>My name is Ki Yunseo, the manager of the Hunter’s Mall on the 6th floor.<br />
Even though the contract was probably cheaper than the items on the sixth floor, the person in charge showed up.<br />
Isn’t this service a bit too much? The person in charge sat opposite me with a polished smile.  </p>
<p>S Class contracts are rare so people who are looking to buy them have to wait for around a few minutes.<br />
I have just sent workers down to the warehouse; I thank you for your understanding.<br />
com for the best novel reading experience.<br />
Oh, yeah.<br />
That’s okay.<br />
I nodded.<br />
Although the S Class contract was a decent price, it was still rare for someone to buy it.<br />
After all, all the S Classes in South Korea were guild masters, with an exception of just one person.<br />
Since I was going to sign a contract with an S Class, it appeared that I was either of a similar level or I had a deep connection with them.<br />
That was why the person in charge came all the way out here to flatter me.<br />
It wasn’t long before the staff brought in a luxurious leather case.  </p>
<p>There are currently 5 types of S Class contracts in our shopping mall.<br />
The most popular one is the Ability-Reduction contract.<br />
The person in charge said, taking out a contract made of parchement paper from the case and placed it onto the table.  </p>
<p>It’s a contract with S Class Hunter Clown Marionette Manuella Shusler’s S Class curse skill; if the terms of the contract are broken, your total stats will be reduced by 20% for a year.<br />
It’s a strong contract that cannot be escaped unless you use a skill or item to nullify the SS Class curse.<br />
Actually, nothing can resolve the curse apart from a saint.<br />
The contract is valid for up to 10 years.<br />
Wait, so I won’t receive any disadvantages for breaking the contract? My curse resistance is L Level.<br />
An S Level curse wouldn’t so much as tickle it.<br />
‘This could be quite useful.<br />
com The thought surfaced in my head for a bit but I quickly got rid of it.<br />
I wouldn’t be the target of the contract, and even if an F Class’ stat were to drop by 20%, there would be not much of a difference.<br />
If it wasn’t a contract from the association, which would just cause a decrease in skills and stats, but an illegal contract that was life-threatening, I could take advantage of it, but I had no intention to use such a contract.  </p>
<p>There are also Skill Level Decrease and Seal contracts.<br />
However, since it is only limited to one less than S Class, it is less efficient for someone with SS Class skills.<br />
The Permanent Stat Reduction contract could work as well, but the other Hunter would not easily accept it.<br />
Even if they wanted to keep the contract, they would be reluctant to do so.<br />
I bought a 1 year Stat Drop contract and a 1 month Skill Seal Contract.<br />
In a flash, 50 million won disappeared.<br />
Nevertheless, there was still 950 million won remaining.<br />
That little brother really doesn’t know how much money is worth.<br />
I will have to thank him for the money he gave me.  </p>
<p>Please show me your mana-boosting equipment as well.<br />
The type that can be worn, and the type that will increase mana by a fixed amount, not by percentage.<br />
The price of equipment that increase stats by percentages was much higher, but they had no use to me.<br />
After all my mana stat was only 2.<br />
The world ranked Hunters would rush in for equipment that gives a +50% to stats, but a C Class and below equipment that simply gave a +5 to stats was much better for me.<br />
Soon, velvet-wrapped luxury cases were placed on the table.  </p>
<p>There are all equipment with certificates from the Korea Hunter’s Association A Class Appraiser Park Jiyeon.<br />
com for the best novel reading experience The person in charge said, opening the cases one after another.<br />
People were able to know the performance of equipment after they were worn, but they could sometimes be cheated through magic or curses.<br />
Therefore expensive equipment would come with a certificate.  </p>
<p>This is a red lumelusus ring.<br />
It is an A Class accessory that can raise your mana by 30.<br />
Mana was a stat that was hard to increase, therefore an A Class equipment would only increase the stat by 30.<br />
I don’t think one ring has enough mana.<br />
‘This is really fancy.<br />
’ The size of the red jewel in the silver ring was as large as a quail egg.<br />
There were even diamond-like gems wrapped around it.<br />
How do you wear this?.<br />
This is the bracelet of Auris Hall.<br />
It is also an A Class accessory that can increase your mana stat.<br />
There was a bracelet woven with walnut-sized blue beads followed by shimmering sapphire necklace and then a leather ribbon headband, each placed in front of me one after the other.<br />
Why did they all look so bad?.<br />
As you know, the sex ratio of male Hunters in the upper levels is more than twice the number of female Hunters, so simple accessories are sold out more quickly.<br />
The person in charge told me this excuse after seeing the wrinkled expression on my face.<br />
Still, wasn’t this too much? Plus, rings and bracelets are embarrassing to wear regardless of gender.<br />
These are the Black Fairy Earrings.<br />
They are A Class accessories that can raise your mana stat by 29.<br />
This is the last A Class mana enhancement equipment product that we have; the remaining products are all C Class or less.<br />
It’s not even B Class but C Class.<br />
I worried as I looked at the Black Fairy Earrings.<br />
They were simple earrings with small black gems that were as small as a grain of rice.<br />
I hate that I would have to pierce my ears, but I’m sure that this accessory would hardly catch anyone’s eye.  </p>
<p>What is the stat increase for C Class equipment?I still asked, just in case.  </p>
<p>The stats can be increased by 5 or 6 points.<br />
No way.<br />
That’s too much of a difference.<br />
If it were an increase of at least 10 points it would have been worth it.<br />
Eventually, I purchased the Black Fairy Earrings.<br />
The price was 230 million won.<br />
This was considered cheap for mana-boosting A Class equipment.<br />
The price of a few hundred million won was considered cheap.<br />
Truly, the upper Hunter society was a completely different world.<br />
The earrings were put on without the need for piercings.<br />
With it, my mana increased to over 30.<br />
I also bought some gloves that increased stamina and strength, and a belt that increased agility.<br />
com ‘Except for mana, all my stats are now at the average of 26.<br />
5.<br />
Those are C Class stats.<br />
’ Although it was unbalanced with a concentration towards physical stats, I had still raised three of my stats with a reasonable amount of money.<br />
Of course, if my level increases the rating of the stats would drop sharply.<br />
That was why people preferred equipment that increased stats via percentages.<br />
I had purchased two more pieces of equipment, but nearly 500 million won was still left.<br />
I had always thought that if I had money, I would be able to spend it all but the surprisingly the amount of money wasn’t going down by a lot.<br />
I couldn’t use this gift card outside.<br />
I bought 20 lesser mana potions and a set of health potions.<br />
And then.<br />
‘Let’s buy armor and weapons.<br />
’ With good equipment, an F Class lower dungeon could be cleared.  </p>
<p>Please show me dungeon equipment that can increase stats by a fixed number.<br />
There were so many options for those that this time, instead of showing me the items themselves, a catalog book was given to me.<br />
There was a large variety of weapons available, but there were only a few things that I could use.<br />
I mainly used the spear before the regression.<br />
I had only partaken in simple battles where I placed buffs on people from behind and also stabbed things with my spear.<br />
The reason I was able to kill Lauchitas was thanks to the fact that I had received some of Yuhyun’s combat skills along with his memories.<br />
I bought a pair of daggers, a pike, and light armor.<br />
They were all placed in my inventory as they could not be worn normally.<br />
It was okay to wear armor but if you were caught carrying a dungeon weapon, you would get a fine and be penalized.<br />
If a Hunter had accumulated more than a number of penalties within a fixed period of time, their Hunter’s qualification would be suspended.<br />
If this was repeated a few times, the qualification would be taken away.<br />
com ‘Now roughly how much did I spend? There’s not much money left… well.<br />
’ I’ve found the perfect thing for me.  </p>
<p>Do you have any items with poison fog or similar effects? Curses are good, too.<br />
Something like a poison spray or something that could make you lose your sight.<br />
I could completely nullify the effects on myself, so I could use it most of the time.<br />
After hearing my words, an employee brought over a black bead that had double protections placed on it.  </p>
<p>This is the Black Poison of S Class Hunter, Poison King Leon Louis Han.<br />
If you do not have an A Class or higher poison resistance skill or item, you will die within 10 seconds of inhalation depending on your current poison resistance rating; neutralization of the poison has to be done within 5 seconds.<br />
The effective radius is 5 meters and you will be immediately arrested and executed if this is used outside of Dungeons.<br />
Poison resistance skills are known to be extremely rare and are A Class skills.<br />
There were no S Class poison resistance skills.<br />
Therefore, even someone with an A Level poison skill would be able to finish off all their opponents.  </p>
<p>Is there anything that affects a wider radius?Instead of 5 meters, if there was a melee monster 100 meters away, I would be able to break even a C Class Dungeon by my own with my items and skills.<br />
For Dungeons B Class and onwards, there are many monsters that could travel 100 meters in three seconds, so there was no way I could win there.<br />
Among the items currently being sold, this Black Poison Bead has the widest effective radius while still maintaining a good effect.<br />
That’s because the effect of poisonous fog gets lighter in proportion to the radius it is dispersed over.<br />
The further the opponent is from you, the longer they would take to die and therefore the rating of the poison is reduced.<br />
In the case of the Black Poison Bead, F Class monsters within a 50 meter radius can be killed within 10 seconds, and they would also be incapacitated within 3 seconds.<br />
50 meters in 3 seconds.<br />
I could clear an F Class Dungeon.<br />
The enemies would face a big loss.  </p>
<p>Most of the curses that randomly target foes are not very effective.<br />
Due to the nature of curses, there is a large difference between someone who randomly receives a curse and someone who signs a contract with a curse.<br />
There are also some kinds that can increase their effectiveness through sacrifices.<br />
That’s enough.<br />
This was just for emergency usage.<br />
Where would I have the time to sit down and offer sacrifices? Eventually I used the rest of the money to purchase three Black Poison Beads and then left the area.<br />
An employee opened the glass door and I took a step outside.<br />
[F Class Hunter Han Yujin who has just registered his Awakening today.<br />
A Class Hunter Kim Sunghan is looking for you.<br />
Please visit and contact the Missing Child Protection Center immediately after hearing this broadcast.<br />
A broadcast sounded out, looking for me.<br />
Fuck, that Kim Sunghan was looking for me through the fucking broadcast.<br />
And why was it the Missing Child Protection Center? He could have just asked me to go to the front door.<br />
With a curse, I quickly headed towards the Missing Child Protection Center before a second broadcast could come out.<br />
com for the best novel reading experience Kim Sunghan was standing in front of the Missing Child Protection Center like a gangster who came to collect money.<br />
Parents who went there to look for their lost children would be scared to death.  </p>
<p>Where did you go?He said, furrowing his brow.<br />
Both his expression and his baritone voice was as fierce as a punch.<br />
If there had been no Fear Resistance to save me, I would not even be able to make a sound.  </p>
<p>I went to buy the contract.<br />
Did I not say that.<br />
You did not.<br />
I forgot.<br />
Sorry about that.<br />
My dry apology made Kim Sunghan’s face even more ominous.<br />
Hey, surely you wouldn’t swing that fist at me in anger, would you? I’m your Guild Leader’s brother.<br />
Please don’t forget that.  </p>
<p>Do you have any other business?What should I do? It’s a long way to Myeongdong Station but should I go there to look for Park Yerim? Or should I go home first? Yuhyun said that he’d move my things, but I still hadn’t packed them.<br />
com for a better experience.<br />
Please go to my house.<br />
The address is.<br />
There’s nothing there.<br />
Really?! I couldn’t move out without a landlord!.<br />
Where have all my things been moved to? The Haeyeon Guild staff quarters.<br />
It’s been moved to a spare room in the Guild Master’s living quarters.<br />
I refuse to live with my younger brother.<br />
I want to live independently and well, not in the hands of my younger brother, who wasn’t even my parent.<br />
Yuhyun-ah, let’s just carelessly burn down our relationship until it’s around half the relationship we had before my regression.<br />
Yeah?.<br />
…then let’s go back to the guild.<br />
I have to organize my things.<br />
As I walked towards the elevator that was connected to the parking lot, the gazes of the people around me stuck to my face.<br />
The gossip backlash was coming.  </p>
<p>com for the best novel reading experience.<br />
What is the relationship between those two.<br />
Kim Sunghan even tried to find him through a broadcast.<br />
There must be something.<br />
Hadn’t they mentioned the Missing Child Protection Center earlier.<br />
At that age.<br />
”Advertisements That woman over there, don’t laugh! Were they collecting people who liked to talk dirty about others, or were they collecting Awakened people! That F Class F Class talk was stinging my ears.<br />
‘Are you an S Class?’ As I had increased my mana, I peered at the people around me.<br />
As expected, there were F Classes everywhere.<br />
Even if there were C Classes, they would not be hanging around as they would be going straight to the guilds.<br />
Named guilds accepted members that were C Class and above.<br />
From B Class onwards, you would get proper treatment wherever you went and people were anxious to bring in one more A Class.  </p>

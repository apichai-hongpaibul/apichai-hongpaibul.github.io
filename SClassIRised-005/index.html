    <h1 id="the-s-classes-that-i-raised-5">The S-Classes That I Raised-5.</h1>
<p>Since I had some time until evening, I decided to go to Korea Hunter Association.<br />
‘I just want to get an F Grade.<br />
’ I intended to reveal only the basic skills and hide the titles and additional skills.<br />
If you have one L-level or S-level defense skill, with F-Grade stats, the L to S-Level assist skill is too much.<br />
If the owner of skills that can be used outside the dungeon, like My Little One’s The Best or Promising Sprout, can’t protect themselves, it was like turning on a billboard saying ‘Kidnap Me’.<br />
They could kidnap me and then blackmail and torture me into using my skills.<br />
If you have assist skills you want to use during combat, you and your party might die, so it’s better to party normally.<br />
However, if it is a skill that can be used outside the dungeon and is not related to combat, it is enough to keep it as a slave without paying for it.<br />
.<br />
In fact, there were a lot of victims out there.<br />
‘That’s why I hid the title of Caregiver.<br />
’ I would have been able to raise the Hunter rating immediately if I told the association, but I was too afraid to do so.<br />
I thought I couldn’t be protected because I believed I had lost my brother.<br />
com Dragon Slayer is hard to explain, so I can only talk about the Perfect Caregiver.<br />
I think you can be a big brother just by doing a good job.<br />
If I recruit a good-looking rookie, I’ll give him a spot rather than kick him out of the guild this time.<br />
I opened the door in a pleasant fancy.<br />
And my eyes met with another’s.  </p>
<p>Uh……A man over 190cm with a tall and muscular figure leaned against the wall of the hallway in front of my door and stared at me bluntly.<br />
Class A Awakening Kim Sunghan.<br />
(김성한) It is one of Han Yuhyun’s faithful right-hand man, the Haeyeon guild leader, and is a battlehunter specialized in defense.<br />
Yuhyun’s loyalty to me was so high that he thought I was an eyesore.<br />
…From the look on his face, he seems to be still think that.<br />
But why are you here? Standing in the road… I was passing through.  </p>
<p>Well… How are you?Kim Sunghan completely ignored my greeting.<br />
What? This didn’t happen before.<br />
When I heard Yuhyun scold me, I got angry and I thought I’d take care of it, so I just stormed out screaming,.<br />
Don’t worry.<br />
com for the best novel reading experience.<br />
I have a few things to see.<br />
Work hard.<br />
I’m going to pass by.  </p>
<p>That’s not possible.<br />
A heavy bass blocked me.<br />
It didn’t just end with a voice, but he even caught my arm.  </p>
<p>The guild leader ordered me to keep you from going out.<br />
……pardon?Why? Did he think I was going to go find the Awakening Broker again.<br />
He didn’t believe me? …I wouldn’t believe me either.<br />
I don’t want to get into an accident.<br />
I’m just going out for a minute and I’ll be right back.<br />
It’s only an hour.<br />
It takes 10 minutes from here to Hunter’s Association by taxi, and there will be fewer people on weekdays, so it will be over in an hour.<br />
But the hand that grabbed my arm did not budge.<br />
Go straight into the room, please.<br />
No, really, just for a second……When I was faced with increasingly fierce eyes, my voice decreased.<br />
Just then.<br />
[The pressure has been annulled! The fear-resistance skill effect has been activated.<br />
But even if you have skills, what can you do? Even if you’re not scared, you’ll still get hit.<br />
It’s so useless.  </p>
<p>Alright.<br />
Going in, going in.<br />
I turned around, brushing away Kim Sunghan’s hand.<br />
In front of a Class A, you are a flea and he is too inflexible to talk sense into.<br />
Oh, by the way, what are his skills? Kim Sunghan’s eyes narrowed as I turned around again.<br />
Dude.<br />
Staring won’t do anything.<br />
The status window popped up with I used Promising Sprout.<br />
com for a better experience Current Stat Class A Awakening Available: Stats A to S Optimization of Initial Skill Indomitable Body (S) Failed to Obtain Regenerative Power (S) Failed to Obtain Shield of the Earth (A) Obtained What a waste! I almost shouted out loud.<br />
You’ve got two S-Level Skills that can be obtained, your maximum level is S-Level! If I recall, Kim Sunghan’s initial skills were the Shield and Footprints of the Earth.<br />
‘Wow, that’s too bad.<br />
Can’t a man who’s already Awakened be Reawakened? Kim Sunghan’s Optimization Awakening!’ [The target’s keyword Attunement is incomplete.<br />
com for the best novel reading experience Oh, keyword.<br />
[Target that has been Awakened cannot undergo Optimal Awakening.<br />
Message windows appeared one after another.<br />
I can’t do that either.<br />
It can’t be helped… [My Little One’s The Best (L) Single Skill Concentration of Growth enables acquisition of new skills, including failed optimization skills.<br />
Wow! Was it possible to focus on one skill? Anyway, the dirty system’s description is not good enough.<br />
There were not many hidden effects that were found in belatedly in this way.<br />
Even without an open message window, I think there’s an additional effect…? There is a skill that I want.<br />
Anyway it’s amazing that you can get an S-Level skill that you previous failed to obtain, jackpot… Jackpot…… I won…… ‘Fuck, keyword.<br />
’ I looked up at Kim Sunghan.<br />
A rude man who is sending a glare to the me who is not going back in.<br />
He’s 20 centimeters taller than me, and he’s a man with a loud voice.<br />
Yeah, I can’t.<br />
I’ll never do it.<br />
com for a better experience I went into the room, smiling as if nothing had happened.<br />
Then I inwardly shouted to myself.<br />
‘Replace keywords!!’ No, reset, reset.<br />
I want to go back again.<br />
Just for one day.<br />
No, just for one hour.<br />
I said that I wasn’t going to do it but I’m sorry, I’m sorry, it would be a dirty waste! ‘It would be helpful if the number of S-Levels in the guild increased by one.<br />
Yeah, I’ll explain it to Yuhyun first and……’ Muttering under my breath, I felt like I was missing something.<br />
…something about keywords? Something about telling others about my skills? An unforeseen circumstance hits the back of the head.<br />
Let’s settle the situation calmly.<br />
Now, I.<br />
com ‘……I’m locked up.<br />
’ I’m trapped.<br />
No one but an A-Level Awakened is standing guard at the door.<br />
It’s too much to simply prevent me from seeking out an accident.<br />
C-Level , or even D-Level, is enough to stop me ‘Yuhyun, you……’ What are you thinking? This has never happened before the regression.<br />
I walked around the room and then sat down on my bed.<br />
‘If this situation right now is just to protect me.<br />
’ It occurred to me that Yuhyun had immediately deleted the broker’s contact information and didn’t let me contact him.<br />
Things have been strange since then.<br />
Even though I am weaker than him, I’m still his older brother.<br />
I’m an adult and no longer obsessed with being a hunter, I can live alone well enough.<br />
Moreover, unlike before the regression, it is already known that there was absolutely no need to do this.<br />
com I rolled my head around and pulled out my cell phone.<br />
I’ll ask him myself.<br />
At the end of a short beep, Yu-hyun answered the phone.  </p>
<p>Uh, it’s nothing much.<br />
I was going to go out for a while, but Kim Sunghan blocked me.<br />
He said it was your order?[Where are you going? The Hunter Association…… I guess I’d better not say that now.  </p>
<p>Just home.<br />
[Why home?.<br />
Do I need a reason to go back to my house? I will come back in the evening.<br />
The voice over the cell phone paused for a moment, but it started again with a lower voice.<br />
com [That’s a little different from what Sunghan said.  </p>
<p>Uh, huh?[He said you’d be back in an hour.  </p>
<p>No, that’s because he was blocking me.<br />
I mean, I was not going anywhere else.<br />
Why is he so sensitive? The uncertainty in my heart became a little bit bigger.<br />
[If you do not have anything special to do, just stay put.<br />
The house is… hyung just join the guild.  </p>
<p>What?[You do not have to live separately.<br />
It’s not like the world is safe these days.<br />
There’s no dungeon near hyung’s house, but you don’t know when and where it might happen, and what if it suddenly pops up? No, the next 5 years are safe.<br />
com [I’ll get you ready for the move.  </p>
<p>What move, hey![I have to go out, so I will not be able to reach you until evening.<br />
If you need anything, tell Sunghan.  </p>
<p>No, wait a minute! Yoohyun!The telephone line went dead.<br />
I looked at my cell phone, feeling both flustered and dumb.<br />
‘Is this also one of the side effects of regression?’ I think my brother’s personality has changed a lot.<br />
What’s wrong with him? ‘The title of Perfect Caregiver, I shouldn’t reveal it.<br />
’ Right now I’m still known as an Unawakened.<br />
If I reveal that I have a very useful assist skill, I might not be able to take one step out of the room.<br />
…I can’t even get out right now.<br />
com Damn it, I’m gonna have to hide it for now and take a look into it.<br />
‘If Yuhyun is going to keep acting weird, I’ll have to build my own power.<br />
’ It is possible only with the title of Perfect Caregiver.<br />
First of all, I have to visit A-Levels and S-Levels of the future and Awaken them.<br />
I wish I was younger.<br />
I’m persuading children to Awaken…… ‘…This is either a conman or a child trafficker.<br />
’ Well, I’m not getting paid for it, and I’ll really Awaken them! I will need to write a contract to make sure the awakened kids do not betray me.<br />
You’ll protect me as my Hunter for a year without revealing the secret of your Awakening, it’ll be enough.<br />
If you can, keep it for the rest of your life! I want to say, but there is no contract item that can keep the S-Level in place for a long time.<br />
The longest was ten years.<br />
If I sweep up all the A to S Levels and using the Growth skill as bait to make them stay, a big guild will soon be completed.<br />
‘Or maybe in the middle it would be okay to merge with Hayeon Guild.<br />
com If I bring a lot of A to S Levels, Yuhyun will have to acknowledge me.<br />
You want to lock me up again? I’m not going to get caught because I have these kids to protect me.<br />
All right, who’s the first one to get hooked up.<br />
Park Yerim, an ice witch who will become an A-Level Awakening after three years.<br />
It’d be nice.<br />
She was able to quickly rise up to S-Level after awakening as an A-Level.<br />
’I was living in Seoul.<br />
I once saw an interview where I had lost my parents to the first Dungeon shock and lived near a relative who owns a restaurant near Myeong-dong Station.<br />
The age is now… fifteen?’ …A girl in middle school.  </p>

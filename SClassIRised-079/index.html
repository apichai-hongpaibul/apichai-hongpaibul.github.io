<p>&lt; Don’t Make Trouble .  </p>
<p>Peace! You’re the best! Oh this pretty thing! Won’t you come to noona? Hm? Hm? Or is it unni?Hanging onto the Horned Flame Lion’s neck, Moon Hyuna was yelling like a tipsy drunkard.<br />
Peace shook his neck as if annoyed, but she didn’t budge an inch and laughed loudly.<br />
The air was thick with dirt and dust.<br />
Mounds of rocks were piled up and strewn about around the giant toad’s corpse.<br />
In between that, Han Yoohyun and Bak Yerim were staring sourly at each other.<br />
They were two people who instinctively avoided each other because their dispositions didn’t match.<br />
But the moment Han Yoojin’s skill was applied, that unpleasantness completely disappeared.<br />
What filled that empty space was a light bond and sense of closeness.<br />
There should’ve been a repulsion, but accepting those feelings was because of the connecting person in the middle, who was none other than Han Yoojin.<br />
It was a type of deception.<br />
Han Yoohyun and Bak Yerim were sufficiently used to sending and receiving positive feelings to and from Han Yoojin.<br />
Enough to not notice that that obvious flow was very slightly twisted.<br />
…Let’s not say anything, the two of us.<br />
Bak Yerim said, with the corners of her eyes slightly wrinkled.<br />
The skill effect had disappeared, but the residual feelings were still remaining.<br />
They had started to be annoyed by the other party, but the good feeling of a bond from being in sync was still the same.<br />
Especially for Bak Yerim, this was her first time meeting a mighty enemy and pouring out as much of her strength as possible in combat.<br />
It was exciting and fun and thrilling.<br />
Even now, with the results of that laid out under her feet, her heart was still pounding, and Han Yoohyun, who had been an eyesore, even looked nice.<br />
Though she didn’t want to acknowledge it and it felt bad.<br />
The level was less so for Han Yoohyun, but he was in a similar situation, so he bitterly nodded his head.<br />
But the one who had been affected the most, more than Moon Hyuna, who had been completely in tune with a highest rank kiseungsu, and Han Yoohyun and Bak Yerim, who had felt weird emotions in their rivalry, was none other than Sung Hyunjae.<br />
The dead giant toad’s back neck was completely dug up.<br />
The wound’s size was enormous, but bodily fluids corresponding to blood didn’t flow.<br />
It was because, of course the wound region, but even inside of that was cooked through as if boiled.<br />
A mark like an extra large beast of a similar size to the Babar had torn into it, instead of a small human.<br />
Sung Hyunjae looked at that, and then lowered his gaze toward the young man he was holding.<br />
Where could something like this have popped out of?He quietly mumbled, as if fascinated.<br />
It was a tone like he had discovered a new type of lifeform that was incredibly interesting.<br />
He had already known of Han Yoojin’s usefulness.<br />
But raising kiseungsu or knowing expected Awakening ranks were all areas he didn’t need to directly influence.<br />
Since the targets that should receive it wasn’t Han Yoojin, but his harvest.<br />
It might have been different if Haeyeon or a different guild had tried to monopolize him, but Han Yoojin was being neutral, so it was enough with maintaining a good enough relationship.<br />
There was no reason to purposely bother a farmer who was working well on his own.<br />
A contract was already signed, and he just needed to receive the excellent harvest.<br />
But now the situation had changed.<br />
A chain of command special skill.<br />
Except for an exceptional case like this time, it was a skill that wasn’t very necessary for an S-Rank Hunter yet.<br />
‘But it won’t be far before the day it becomes important comes.<br />
’ Sung Hyunjae had known before anybody else, accurately, that the dungeons’ level of difficulty was increasing.<br />
He was expecting cooperation between S-Rank Hunters to become essential in not that long of a time.<br />
com When that time came, a command skill that influenced even S-Rank Hunters would become the most important.<br />
Not just that, it was appealing that the skill user’s stats were low.<br />
There was no Hunter who welcomed someone who could threaten them, directly interfering with them physically and mentally.<br />
But Han Yoojin was weak enough to not be even a little bit of a bother.<br />
And if you strongly rejected the skill, you could break it off.<br />
It was to the point that sensitive high rank Hunters would think, ‘Let’s tolerantly accept him since he won’t be harmful and is useful.<br />
’ It was suitable to the point of wondering if it was matched on purpose.<br />
And one more thing, sharing the doubled attack skill effect.<br />
Sung Hyunjae’s lips unconsciously formed a smile.<br />
‘The sensation is definitely different from just hearing it in words.<br />
’ There wouldn’t be anybody who wouldn’t find wielding a powerful strength appealing.<br />
And among that, force showed the fastest and most certain results, so you couldn’t help but fall for it, once you stepped into it.<br />
On top of that, for Hunters, there existed targets that they could legally exert violence towards, called monsters.<br />
And large rewards followed that.<br />
You could wield inhuman strength as much as you wanted, and break and stomp on enemies and get even stronger.<br />
com A powerful body that you could control perfectly and highly pure mana that dominated the surroundings, and formed from those as a basis, skills beyond common sense with enormous destructive power.<br />
It was obvious that the higher rank the Hunter, the stronger the sense of freedom and pleasure was from combat.<br />
The sensation of a doubled attack skill effect for somebody who was at the peak of those Hunters, was like a type of drug.<br />
It was different from when he just knew it was two times.<br />
It was to the point of feeling even fury at the truth that he had to throw away the strength he had already gotten a taste of and return to normal.<br />
Why was this a human? If it was a dungeon item, he would’ve taken it no matter what he had to do.  </p>
<p>Is hyung alright?Just then, the four including Han Yoohyun came over.  </p>
<p>Naturally there is no injury, and he just fell asleep.<br />
That is a relief.<br />
Please hand him over.<br />
Han Yoohyun held out his hands as if it was obvious.<br />
Sung Hyunjae unconsciously frowned.<br />
If he passed over Han Yoojin like this, there was no way to promise when the next time could be.<br />
He knew well how excessively that young guy in front of him defended his hyung.<br />
Even if Han Yoojin said it was okay, there was no way he would send him obediently into a high rank dungeon.<br />
com Of course Han Yoohyun, but the other guys too.<br />
The attack skill effect doubling was still being shared.<br />
Even if he massacred the other S-Ranks here, the 1st Rank monster’s corpse and that reward was there, so there was enough excuses and evidence.<br />
If it was like that, even the kiseungsu related contract would only have MKC and Hanshin remaining.<br />
MKC wouldn’t be able to put themselves forward properly, and Hanshin was at a level that was easy to step on.<br />
And the blacksmith couldn’t be a big threat yet.  </p>
<p>I asked you to return him.<br />
Maybe he had felt the serious mood, because Han Yoohyun’s expression hardened.<br />
Bak Yerim, who had left Peace and was teasing Moon Hyuna, also shut her mouth.<br />
Chareureu The Seeker’s Chains wrapped around Sung Hyunjae as if protecting him.<br />
Looking at that, Han Yoohyun’s eyes settled into a dark red.  </p>
<p>That’s quite a scary gleam in your eyes.<br />
Are you going to come at me, young master.<br />
Yes, again.<br />
Didn’t I send the signal starting from yesterday? I’m curious as to how much young master has grown.<br />
I would like to satisfy your expectations, but say it after you return hyung first.<br />
I don’t want to.<br />
Sung Hyunjae smiled.<br />
That growling was also cute.<br />
Bak Yerim’s unenthusiastic voice suddenly cut through the tautly strained air.  </p>
<p>If the two of you fight like that, ahjussi will probably turn into about 50 pieces.<br />
It was a tone like she was just throwing a rebuke, but the eyes of the person speaking was too cold for words.<br />
Next to her, Moon Hyuna spoke purposefully cheerfully.  </p>
<p>That’s right.<br />
So why don’t you pass hyung-nim over here and then fight? I’ll keep my mouth shut so the two you do your own thing.<br />
I won’t tattle on you, I promise.<br />
Unni, aren’t you being too obvious about telling a lie? You’re really thinking of watching the fight and then even profiting off that.<br />
Bak Yerim only smiled with her mouth and took out a mana potion.<br />
Moon Hyuna also stabbed the giant spear that she had previously put into her inventory, into the ground in front of her feet.<br />
Peace bared his canines a little, too.<br />
In the meantime, Kim Sunghan had also arrived.<br />
Looking around at the atmosphere, he didn’t ask and glared at Sung Hyunjae.<br />
Hm? Dear Hyunjae-ssi.<br />
Give the glass bead here.<br />
It’ll break after coming all the way to the last stretch.<br />
At Moon Hyuna’s words, Sung Hyunjae’s gaze went toward Han Yoojin, specifically that person’s wrist.<br />
He saw the cracked crude bracelet.<br />
It was a long time since 10 minutes had passed.<br />
‘Moon Hyuna is a problem.<br />
’ The other three people, even the Horned Flame Lion, wouldn’t be able to attack properly due to the worry over Han Yoojin.<br />
But Moon Hyuna was different.<br />
It was obvious that she would aim for Han Yoojin the moment she realized that the doubled attack skill effect was still applied.<br />
‘And to properly use him, a special item will be necessary, too.<br />
’ When he thought like that, his head cooled.  </p>
<p>There’s so many eyes and mouths being noisy, so I guess there’s no choice.<br />
Speaking like he was quitting because it was annoying that he was going to get tattled on, Sung Hyunjae passed Han Yoojin over to Han Yoohyun.<br />
After draping on the coat he received back, he rested his eyes on the traces of the destruction that he had created, and then turned his gaze right away.<br />
Even if he continued to regret, he would only get dragged down.  </p>
<p>Okay, okay, let’s quickly finish and go out.<br />
com When the situation was settled, Moon Hyuna waved her hand and spoke.<br />
Compared to the giant toad, only things about the level of a tadpole, no toad eggs, were left.<br />
There was no reason to drag it out.<br />
***.<br />
There is no doubt.<br />
It was aiming for Han Yoojin.<br />
Newcomer said, nervously.<br />
Next to him, Tree was recovering the number G-15 dungeon, Black Golem’s City.<br />
Through an air distortion, a 5 years later monster that had been blocked burst out.<br />
It happened to be that a lot of S-Rank Hunters were gathered, so a dangerous guy had appeared, suiting that.<br />
If it wasn’t quickly restored, similar things would happen in other dungeons.  </p>
<p>Could they have already noticed? What should we do with our Honey.<br />
It’s not that so calm down.<br />
It was trying to bring over Han Yoojin, not kill him.<br />
And the location was within Honey’s world.<br />
Somebody must’ve used a teleportation skill.<br />
At Tree’s words, Newcomer’s expression briefly became brighter and then became dark again.  </p>
<p>Then could it be that side? Those guys trying to be filial.<br />
Maybe.<br />
Since, at the least, it should’ve been an SSS-Rank skill, or highly likely an L-Rank skill.<br />
They shouldn’t be able to directly get involved yet, but we should check.<br />
com Messages popped up on the window that had been pitch black dead.  </p>
<p>Ah, they have already caught the Babar! That was really fast.<br />
That’s right.<br />
I thought they would’ve had a bit of a hard time with the current combat power.<br />
Honey also had a high level of contribution.<br />
The attack time was fast with a team including a stat F-Rank, too; the achievement amount should be considerable.<br />
The rewards for the dungeon attack and monster hunting were decided according to the achievement amount.<br />
Normally, the system automatically calculated it, but in exceptional cases, the administrators directly calculated and picked the rewards.<br />
Tree moved their fingers around and connected appropriate rewards to each person.  </p>
<p>Finally, for our Honey – normal equipment should be useless.<br />
It seemed like he needed high rank integer increase equipment, though.<br />
There’s the blacksmith.<br />
He doesn’t need it.<br />
Rather than that… this should be good.<br />
After drawing out all the rewards amounts and connecting one special item, they turned off the window.<br />
com *** -Cheep cheep cheep chirp Small mumbling tickled my ears.<br />
When I opened my eyes, I saw an unfamiliar ceiling.<br />
First of all, it seemed like we had left the dungeon -Chirp! Chirp! Next to my head, Chirpie flapped.<br />
Alright, alright.<br />
Stop hitting my face, it hurts.  </p>
<p>Ahjussi.<br />
Yoojin!It was Yerim and Myeongwoo.<br />
I grabbed Chirpie and raised my body.<br />
Where was this place? It was a quite wide room without windows.<br />
And my clothes… seemed to be a hospital gown so was this a hospital? When I turned to look, Myeongwoo was on the verge of tears.<br />
Did I sleep for long.<br />
For two days! The hospital said that you were okay, but…… I mean even four S-Rank Hunters followed you in, but why couldn’t they protect a single person?!At Myeongwoo’s angry shout, Yerim looked away.<br />
I had been tired, but I didn’t know I would sleep for two days straight.<br />
Still, it seemed like there wasn’t anything weird about my body.<br />
And my head was clear.<br />
Just then, the door opened and Kim Sunghan came in.<br />
When he saw me, he smiled brightly.  </p>
<p>So you have woken up!And then at Myeongwoo’s dirty look, he turned his head like Yerim.<br />
Well, Myeongwoo was the person with power here.<br />
Especially for the two fledgling S-Ranks here, he was even more powerful.<br />
Of course Yerim, but even Kim Sunghan with quite a lot of experience, wouldn’t have much S-Rank equipment.<br />
S-Rank equipment wasn’t common yet, so S-Rank Hunters were prioritized in taking them.<br />
For them to quickly get all the equipment they needed, the best way was to borrow Myeongwoo’s strength.  </p>
<p>Don’t be like that.<br />
Before the 1st Rank monster suddenly appeared, there wasn’t any problem.<br />
Even if they are S-Rank Hunters, how could they have predicted such an abnormal thing and stopped it? And they all cooperatively hunted the 1st Rank monster well, too.<br />
com Even after that, they probably finished the attack well without much of a problem, right? They wouldn’t have picked fights again and fought in that chaos.  </p>
<p>What about Blue?I asked, petting Chirpie.  </p>
<p>She was too noisy, so we couldn’t bring her to the hospital.<br />
She was a little sullen because she couldn’t see ahjussi, but she’s well.<br />
And she eats well too.<br />
Chirpie kept on crying the whole day starting from the second day, so there was no helping it.<br />
We got permission from the hospital and Association and brought it over.<br />
So it was like that, our Chirpie.<br />
You wanted to see dad?.<br />
Did Yoohyun go into a dungeon.<br />
Ah, yes.<br />
Yerim replied a little sourly.<br />
Avoiding my eyes, it seemed like she was hiding something.<br />
com for a better experience.<br />
Wasn’t Sunghan-ssi supposed to go as well.<br />
Ah… that is.<br />
”Advertisements Kim Sunghan also avoided my gaze.<br />
What was it?.<br />
And Peace.<br />
Peace went along, but that is…Yerim hesitated and then continued.  </p>
<p>Guild Leader and Peace, just the two of them went.<br />
……Huh?For a moment, I didn’t really understand.<br />
So, the two of them, just the two of them…… My heart sank and the Fear Resistance skill message window popped up.<br />
……An S-Rank dungeon.<br />
Yes.<br />
The other guild members followed inside, but they were all chased out.<br />
They said the mood was really scary.<br />
Still, they said it was a dungeon that suited them well, so even if they have a hard time, they would be unharmed…Even so, it was an S-Rank dungeon.<br />
Since an S-Rank Hunter was necessary, at minimum a mid to high grade.<br />
Going in there taking only Peace? And what sin had Peace committed? I mean, he wasn’t a guy who would forcefully drag him along…… Even if it was a manageable place, an S-Rank dungeon attack time was long.<br />
If it was just the two of them, they wouldn’t be able to rest properly.<br />
Really… Yoohyun, this crazy bastard.<br />
If you’re upset about something, say it through words, you brother bastard.  </p>

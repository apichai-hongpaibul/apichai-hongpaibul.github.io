<h1 id="vocanic-age-chapter-12">Vocanic Age Chapter 12</h1>
<p>Editor: Summerstood, Imagine
â€˜It is like I thought.
 Yu Jong Moks appearance was contained in Ju Seo Cheons eyes.
 Yu Jong Mok was still slowly executing the Five Elements Plum Blossom Sword Art but he was quite different from when he was executing the Fourteen Stances of the Plum Blossom Sword.
 He was giving consideration to his disciple so that he was able to see comfortably.
 Thats why he chose to take bigger postures while facing the direction of Ju Seo Cheon so that he would be able to see more.</p>
<p>It would have been hard enough to execute the movements slowly but he was also giving consideration to his disciple.</p>
<p>But his consideration strangely stopped when the third stance of the Five Elements Plum Blossom Sword Art started.
 A posture that couldnt be grasped well came out.
 It wasnt because Yu Jong Mok got tired in the middle or it was troublesome.
 It was the opposite.</p>
<p>He had forgotten the existence of his disciple and fell completely in the Five Elements Plum Blossom Sword Art.</p>
<p>â€˜The future changes with my actions.
 I didnt know that I would be the master twice.</p>
<p>Just now Ju Seo Cheon sensed something strange when Yu Jong Mok showed his martial arts.</p>
<p>â€˜An unbalance in the five elements.
 The water attribute has increased exponentially due to having consumed the Water Spirit Fruit.</p>
<p>He had stopped his vessel from leaking with the power of the Water Spirit Fruit.</p>
<p>At first, he believed that that was everything but it seemed like that wasnt the case.
 It was faint but its remnants still remained.</p>
<p>Ju Seo Cheon didnt know it until Yu Jong Mok showed him the Fourteen Stances of the Plum Blossom Sword.</p>
<p>Yu Jong Mok manifested sword qi with all his strength and soon got able to feel frost energy and water energy from it.</p>
<p>Thats why Ju Seo Cheon requested him to execute the Five Elements Plum Blossom Sword Art slowly.</p>
<p>The Five Elements Plum Blossom Sword Art was a martial arts containing the five elements, just like its name implied.
 It was just perfect to fix the unbalance of the five elements.</p>
<p>And having requested him to execute it slowly was to make him concentrate.
 He may be able to miss it because it was really minute.</p>
<p>â€˜I didnt know that one miraculous medicine would make it like thisâ€¦
He fixed his weak constitution that he thought was a chronic disease and that became a clue to increase his boundary.</p>
<p>While he was thinking, Yu Jong Mok executed the Five Elements Plum Blossom Sword Art until the last stance and then immediately begun circulating his internal energy.</p>
<p>It was to absorb the insight he gained right now and increase his boundary.</p>
<p>Ju Seo Cheon stopped his breathing and stood guard to not obstruct Yu Jong Mok.</p>
<p>â€˜The unbalance of the five elements is merely the trigger.</p>
<p>The remains of the Water Spirit Fruit, its not that there was a lot of water energy either.
 Even if it was an unbalance, that level wasnt serious at all.</p>
<p>It only complimented the minute parts, the frost energy stabilized even more and increased to the size of a fingernail.</p>
<p>Then what is Yu Jong Moks real insight?
â€˜Rest.</p>
<p>Yu Jong Mok was a diligent hard worker.</p>
<p>But that level of hard work was a bit excessive.
 It was to the point that he was called a blockhead.</p>
<p>It was the same even after he fell from being a candidate of the Plum Blossom Sword Examiner.
 He never stopped to rest his entire life and always continued to work hard.</p>
<p>Some of his fellow disciples got sick of his diligence.</p>
<p>This hard work was so excessive it was seen as an obsession.
 It didnt matter no matter what anyone told him.</p>
<p>He had been diligent and worked hard his entire life and after entering Mount Hua Sect he had been tense all the time, never stopping to rest.</p>
<p>You could already see that by looking at the enhancement gymnastics.</p>
<p>Yu Jong Mok had just pushed himself too much.</p>
<p>â€˜Ahh, theres a need to let it go at times.</p>
<p>The five elements was a cycle, a natural flow.</p>
<p>Yu Jong Mok thought, pondered and understood about the consequences that would bring when he fixed the unbalance of the five elements.</p>
<p>He realized that sometimes he had to leave things flow naturally like water after comprehending the cycle.</p>
<p>He would awaken and comprehend the wood energy, the five elements and the cycle.</p>
<p>And he finally succeeded in overcoming that wall.</p>
<p>A long time passed and Yu Jong Mok finally opened his eyes.</p>
<p>The light in his eyes and the degree of his qi changed completely.</p>
<p>Leisure that couldnt be seen before was now seen.</p>
<p>But his soft and comfortable smile remained the same.
 Now that leisure was added on top of that, he now looked like a wise man.</p>
<p>Its not me who is the one teaching but you.
 All of this is thanks to you.
 The first thing he said were words filled with a sweet voice.</p>
<p>Ju Seo Cheon yelled with a thrilled voice.</p>
<p>Congratulations master! Ju Seo Cheon got sincerely happy.</p>
<p>Before returning in time he had only been luggage to his master.
 He was regretful as hell that he wasnt able to see him on his deathbed.
 Ju Seo Cheon didnt feel comfortable as he felt like he had only been a weight to his masterâ€¦ so he felt happy that at least he was able to fix an old problem like this.</p>
<p>Ju Seo Cheon got thankful at his new life once again.</p>
<p>Ho, so he reached Peak?
Yu Jong Mok had reached the Peak.
 It didnt take a day for those news to spread.</p>
<p>Those are really happy events!
There were many experts around the nine factions such as Mount Hua.
 It wasnt called a great sect for nothing.</p>
<p>Even if that was the case, they werent that numerous.
 Peak level experts were treated as a precious force even in great sects.</p>
<p>And Yu Jong Mok became one of those pinnacle experts.
 It was enough to receive attention.</p>
<p>The fellow disciples of Yu Jong Mok went to meet him and congratulated him.</p>
<p>Ju Seo Cheon saw for the first time that there were so many visitors coming to their residence in all his life, including his current and previous ones.</p>
<p>I believed that you would be able to do it someday.
 As expected of the Smiling Gentle Sword.</p>
<p>Its not much but please take it.</p>
<p>Yu Jong Moks influence wasnt that wide.
 The ones he could call as close were merely five.
 The number of people that visited him recently surpassed the hundred but most of them were people that wanted to form a connection with him.</p>
<p>It was an obvious thing but in Mount Hua Sect there werent only people belonging to that sect.</p>
<p>In case of the inner disciples of high status, they would have servants to carry their buyings and some escort knights.</p>
<p>Besides them there were also clients, merchants and all kinds of other people around them.</p>
<p>There were a considerable number of them having the objective of forming a connection with the disciples of the head temple.</p>
<p>No, precisely speaking almost all of the visitors had that thought.</p>
<p>This place was none other than the Mount Hua Sect, one of the nine factions.
 If they could establish a connection they would have gained one of the most reliable swords.</p>
<p>In the case of normal sized sects, almost no one would be able to push them around them if they had a connection with a disciple of the Mount Hua Sect.</p>
<p>Put that in a bad way, it meant that they could exercise the connection to the Mount Hua Sect as an authority.</p>
<p>â€˜Ugh, master is soâ€¦
Ju Seo Cheon let out a sigh inwardly.</p>
<p>He had learned how to rest but his upright nature was still the same.</p>
<p>â€˜He could just say that he is tired and no one would approach him anymoreâ€¦
Ju Seo Cheon was worried about him but Yu Jong Mok only smiled softly and faced the people.</p>
<p>But the fortunate thing is that his master knew how to differentiate between an honest and dishonest man so he wasnt treated as a pushover or get into any sort of owing debt or favor
He showed great proficiency at not accepting gifts or accepting them at a moderate line.</p>
<hr />
<p>At the peak of the Lotus Peak was the Shang Palace.</p>
<p>It was a structure that existed since the beginning of Mount Hua Sect and it hadnt changed once throughout its long history.</p>
<p>They had called the best architects to structure it and a considerable amount of effort, time and money was spent into maintaining it.
 That place was that important.
 The landscape you could see of Mount Hua from Shang Temple was such a grand and beautiful sight that everyone would drop their jaws looking at it.</p>
<p>Its reputation was so amazing that elegant people would dream of it at least once.</p>
<p>Besides the scenery, the palace itself was also really incredible.</p>
<p>It was obvious as they had spent an astronomical amount of money by calling the best architects, even though that happened a long time ago.</p>
<p>Its perfect structure was one thing and its outer appearance was also outstanding.</p>
<p>They didnt have the same power as the emperor so they made it look poorer than the golden palace but it was still one of the best structures in the midlands.</p>
<p>Yu Jong Mok, I knew he would be able to accomplish it.</p>
<p>Inside the temple, an old man with a flashing white beard was sitting in front of the top seat, and laughed in a good mood.</p>
<p>There were a hundred experts below this old man.</p>
<p>Those people were called the Hundred Experts.
 Most of them were composed by pinnacle experts and there were also some Trasncendent Realm Experts among them.</p>
<p>Did that mean that the peak of Murim was the Hundred Experts?
No.</p>
<p>There were beings that were above Transcendents and had surpassed the limits of humans and received awe and respect.</p>
<p>They were the Heavenly Ten Seats.</p>
<p>The Hundred Experts were always under the sky.</p>
<p>There is always someone flying above the one that was running.</p>
<p>There were ten absolute experts above the sky.</p>
<p>And they were called the Heavenly Ten Seats.</p>
<p>The old man that was sitting at the top seat was one of those people.</p>
<p>The Sword Master and wise man Woo il Moon.</p>
<p>The master of Mount Hua Sect!
If it wasnt for his weak constitution he would have already become a Plum Blossom Sword Examiner.
 its really regretful.</p>
<p>Middle aged men were sitting at the sides of Woo il Moon.</p>
<p>They were the aides of the leader of Mount Hua, the Five Elders that had the most authority after the leader.</p>
<p>Hm, I heard that his weak constitution got better after he reached the pinnacle rankâ€¦
Oh.</p>
<p>Woo il Moon showed interest.</p>
<p>Yu Jong Mok was a peak expert but he wasnt considered as a proper force until now.
 It was because of his weak constitution.</p>
<p>That wasnt a bad thing.
 He had a good personality, was so hard working he was called as a cold blooded person and had quite the talent.
 But he lacked endurance due to his weak constitution so he didnt receive proper tasks.</p>
<p>Hm, how about examining him once again? In the position of Mount Hua Sect, leaving Yu Jong Mok aside was just like letting a talent rot.</p>
<p>A wise decision.
 The future changed once again.</p>
<p>After that, Yu Jong Mok was mentioned while a meeting was taking place in the Shang Temple.</p>
<p>This meeting that was opened by the leader and the Five Elders was nominally and virtually the best meeting held in Mount Hua.</p>
<p>The matter of what to do with a pinnacle expert was enough to enter in the meeting of the Shang Temple.</p>
<p>And about fifteen days later.</p>
<p>After consuming the Water Spirit Fruit, Yu Jong Mok didnt cough even once since fifteen days passed after the meeting in the Shang Temple ended.</p>
<p>The chief executives came to the conclusion that Yu Jong Moks weak constitution was completely healed.
 They called him and gave him a new task.</p>
<p>And that was making an appearance in Kang Ho.</p>
<p>Oh, my god.</p>
<p>Something really unprecedented had happened.</p>
<p>After Ju Seo Cheon became Yu Jong Moks disciple, there has never been a time that he went out to Kang Ho besides friendly matters.
 He didnt know how surprised he got after hearing those news.</p>
<p>Ugh.</p>
<p>Honestly speaking, he felt uneasy.</p>
<p>Yu Jong Moks future would be pitch black if he was to appear in Kang Ho.</p>
<p>Even if we were talking about Ju Seo Cheon, the one that knew the future of dozens of years later, it didnt mean that he knew everything.</p>
<p>the current situation was like that.
 This future was one he had never experienced before.</p>

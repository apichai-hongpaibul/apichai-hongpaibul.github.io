<p>&lt; Preparations Done (1) &gt;
Han Yoohyun and Sung Hyunjae.
The two people stared at me.
Yoohyun had an expression that said ‘let’s just talk separately’, and Sung Hyunjae had a gleam in his eyes that said ‘quickly spill it’.
While sitting down, I let the silence sit for a moment before opening my mouth.</p>
<p>It may be a surprising topic, but what do you think of Awakening Centers?
Awakening Centers?There were expressions asking why that was suddenly coming up.</p>
<p>Yes.
It should be about three months until the announcement.
Right now should be the height of the interior facilities construction.
If it is possible, could I hear an explanation about the Awakening Center facilities?Of course, it wasn’t that I didn’t know.
Just how many times, and how detailedly, did they explain on TV? At my words, the two people exchanged gazes for a moment.
The one who opened his mouth was Sung Hyunjae.</p>
<p>The core of the Awakening Centers is an A-Rank item, Illusion Maze.
It’s a mind-related item that shows someone an illusion similar to reality.
But for mind-related items or types of skills, if your Mental stat is even a little high, it often doesn’t work.
Even as an E-Rank, apparently you feel a sense of separation.
But if the targets are Unawakened People, it can safely and realistically threaten them and make them Awaken.
The Awakening Center’s method of Awakening was simple.
It showed you an illusion of being attacked by monsters and made you Awaken.
It wasn’t that there weren’t any cases where people received a psychological blow, but it was a comparatively safe and accurate method.
com And obviously, most were Awakened with combat skills, possibly combat assistance skills.
Since it was Awakening from trying to survive monsters.</p>
<p>It takes an average of 17 minutes for one person to Awaken, and there is a limit of 30 minutes since psychological problems can occur.
Currently, there’s a total of five Illusion Mazes that the Association possesses and each one can apply illusions to up to thirty people at once.
Then in approximately thirty minutes, one hundred and fifty people could Awaken.
It isn’t 100% Awakening, so in actuality, it should be a little less than that, but I heard that they’re planning on initially increasing the number of Awakened People to a thousand per day, and within half a year, up to three thousand.
Even if it was just a thousand people per day, if it was ten days, it would be ten thousand, one month, thirty thousand.
If it was the same as the future’s ratio, one out of a hundred of those twenty thousand, two thousand, would qualify to be a Hunter.
On top to that, did the initial thousand people only go for about two days? At people’s insistence, it rose to three thousand, even four thousand in an instant.
They didn’t rest on holidays either.
The news headline at that time: The number of Awakened People in the Awakening Center’s opening first month exceeded hundred thousand! It meant that in one month, as much as a thousand novice Hunters had poured out.
As a person who had been involved in the center of that chaos, I couldn’t help but unconsciously frown.</p>
<p>Don’t you think that is too many? Even now, dungeons are being sufficiently and safely managed.
Even if you said it was thirty thousand every month, there would only be ten among them with usable combat power.
Practically speaking, you can’t say it’s a lot.
com ……That’s, well.
That was right.
In that person’s eyes, you had to be at least B-Rank to be usable.
Even socially, you had to be C~D-Rank for people to go ‘oh, you’re a Hunter’.
Even speaking of F-Rank me, I was painted with the stereotype of being F-Rank, so there was no point in saying more.</p>
<p>Even so, there would be hundreds of people getting Hunter licenses every month.
That means that novice low rank Hunters who could go into dungeons would come pouring out.
If they had mediocre abilities and gave up on being Hunters, then that would be a relief.
But the cases where they didn’t do so would be a problem.
Especially since, for the initial Hunters from the Awakening Center, there were hardly any cases where they gave up.
People around them kept on goading them on, and even the TV prattled on that all they had left to do was to succeed.</p>
<p>The quality of training would of course fall, and the supply of low rank items would become lacking.
The Awakening Center Awakening wouldn’t come with the registration subsidy, and you had to pay for the basics program, too.
At that, it was a week-long boarding program before, but it wouldn’t be long before it would decrease to three days, and finally one day.</p>
<p>I know what hyung is worrying about.
Yoohyun said.
Then Sung Hyunaje also lightly pulled his laced fingers apart and lifted them.</p>
<p>Clumsy Hunters would pour out, and clumsily run to dungeons and die.
But Han Yoojin-gun, even we can’t do anything about that.
Anyone could easily become an Awakened Person.
It’s a cool story.
It was obviously so.
Just seeing how the line that stayed the night for days and days didn’t break off, it was a story that everyone would think charming.
But then noncommittally restricting that? Of course, for safety, about a hundred per day is an appropriate number.
If it’s that amount, about thirty new Hunters would appear per month, so it would be possible to manage them stably.
But if a facility that could Awaken at most three thousand restricted it to, not even half, but thirty people per day, the soaring approval ratings would hit rock bottom.
Approval ratings.
Was it a political issue? 
In the first place, you can’t deceive them by saying it’s only possible for only a hundred per day.
There are already many Hunters who know the effect of the Illusion Maze item.
And even if the Awakening Centers said they would place a restriction, if the Awakening method was revealed publicly, private Awakening Centers would form without a doubt.
It’s been decided that the Association would manage C-Rank and higher mind-related items and skills, but would everyone reliably uphold that? In the end, there’s no way to stop the outpour of unprepared low rank Hunters.
But if that many people die or get hurt, the social impact will be big.
There is also a high possibility of giant guilds being tangled up in it.
It was like that in reality too.</p>
<p>We also know that.
That’s why we’re planning on putting out a scapegoat.
Yoohyun said.
A scapegoat.
The one that suddenly came to mind was MKC.
In the original future, they endured up to three years later, but… it seemed like the two of them getting together and whispering was about using MKC as a throwaway card and profiting.
‘Yoohyun.
Originally, Haeyeon Guild and I were dragged into it.
com Of course, Haeyeon didn’t go so far as going under, and instead, I remembered that three or so big-ish guilds were beaten up as representatives.
Guilds had monopolized easy dungeons, had luckily taken advantageous positions and there wasn’t support for latecomers, look at these three guilds swindling low rank Hunters, etc.
– they were driven into a corner through the mistakes of several guilds, not the government and Association, and sensational journalists had poured out.
Though I was also busy getting hit by it, so I didn’t accurately remember things other than my own matters.
If it was something like MKC, it would become an excellent punching bag.</p>
<p>And even if it wasn’t an election problem, it is necessary for the Awakening Center to produce Awakened People.
Sung Hyunjae said.</p>
<p>Dungeons are being managed safely, but it won’t continue forever.
As you know, the proportion of high rank Hunters is extremely low.
To make enough high rank Hunters with that low proportion, there is no choice but for many low rank Hunters to appear.
Continuing, Yoohyun added an explanation.</p>
<p>What the government and the Association want is also the many high rank Hunters.
Industries related to dungeon byproducts are quickly being developed.
And valuable byproducts usually come from high rank dungeons.
But, even for the country’s high rank dungeons, though the management is done well, attacks can’t be done exactly matching the reset time except for the sole highly valuable minority.
Since the number of high rank Hunters is lacking.
Those remaining dungeons are also a waste, but it’s not far until it’ll be possible to bid for foreign dungeons as well.
Targeted toward countries that can’t properly manage their dungeons and Hunters.
So they want to increase the number of high rank Hunters even a little faster.
Both had faces that showed that they thought it was a slight sacrifice for the future.
com Right, well.
Only about the first year was a fuss, and then it did get stable.
As the number of high rank, mid rank Hunters rose sharply, dungeon industries developed more and more.
Unconsciously, I sighed.</p>
<p>Hyung, don’t be so concer-.
If we make people stop on their own from going to the Awakening Centers, and find high rank Awakened People faster than the Awakening Centers.
Then, there wouldn’t be a problem.
A strange glint shone slightly in the eyes of Sung Hyunjae, who had seemed like he was listening to a young child’s complaint.
On the other hand.
Yoohyun was hugely taken aback.</p>
<p>Wait, hyung! What are you trying to do?
It sounds to me as if Han Yoojin-gun is saying he could do something like this.
You have heard correctly.
Hyung!That guy Yoohyun kicked his seat and stood up.
It seemed like he had guessed what I was going to say.
Just looking at his expression, it seemed like he would grab the scruff of my neck and drag me out.
I did good to say it where the Seseong Guild Leader was present.</p>
<p>Don’t get worked up and sit down.
I was thinking of revealing it anyways.
But……
Seeing the young master’s reaction, I feel more and more interest building up.
It wasn’t anything much.</p>
<p>I am thinking of making a special Awakening Center.
I said, gesturing at Yoohyun to sit.
He glared at me, and then finally sat down again.
With his mouth shut tight, it seemed like he was sulking.</p>
<p>Yes.
Like what it sounds like, it is an Awakening Center with a specialty for Awakened People with special skills.
Since the Association’s Awakening Center can only do combat-related Awakenings right now.
…Is that possible?
Yes.
My skill can know an Unawakened Person’s possible Awakening stats and optimized initial skills.
Even just knowing the optimized initial skills, it would not be difficult to match them and make the person Awaken.
……Hyung, really.
Yoohyun grumbled as if groaning.
I also didn’t think of revealing it, like our promise, but it was because of the situation.</p>
<p>……Can you know without restriction?
Of course, without a restriction, from F-Rank to S-Ranks and higher.
But, for the skills, I can only see the names and have to guess the effects.
Sung Hyunjae’s expression became serious.</p>
<p>Please call it a coincidence before getting the skill.
For my trust.
Truthfully, is it not coincidence to discover S-Rank Hunters?
So, are you saying you’ll stop people from going to normal Awakening Centers with the special Awakening Center?
Yes.
The method is simple.
The number of people that the special Awakening Center will be able receive is 100 per day.
Adding on to that, it will be known that if you Awaken at the combat specialized normal Awakening Centers, you will not be able to get your original aptitude-based special skills.
Of course, there was the possibility of getting it as the 10 level skill, depending on how much you worked.
But it definitely wouldn’t be easy.
To raise your levels, you had to go into dungeons, and naturally only combat abilities would become emphasized.
So usually, you’d get the 10 level skill as combat-related too.</p>
<p>There is enough time left until the opening of the Awakening Centers, so before that, I am thinking of gathering Awakened People with special skills.
While I am at it, it would be good if they are people with low stats and high special skills.
The majority of Awakened People are F-Rank.
If these people had also Awakened normally, they would have become ordinary F-Ranks.
But because they Awakened to aptitude-matched special skills, they became C-Rank, B-Rank.
It is that kind of story.
A normal Awakening Center? That is doing something that will bury your hidden talent! Somehow B-Rank, possibly A-Rank, and higher that that too! Please look at this blacksmith with an SS-Rank skill, who was an F-Rank Hunter.
Awakened Person, of course you would want to be one.
But with a hasty choice, an SS-Rank special skill that is revered worldwide could be lost forever! Something like this.</p>
<p>Still, if you’re limiting it to a hundred people, there will be quite some people who wouldn’t be able to wait.
I am planning on announcing that once the data piles up and a system is made, the number of people admitted to the special Awakening Center will increase.
I will just quickly check the skills and other people will do the consultation on the rest.
Then, they would have a little more patience.
com for a better experience Checking a status window was finished within ten seconds.
If we computerized and other people took care of the skill analysis and consultation after I entered the data, over one hundred could be checked in one hour.
And anyways, there would only be one or two people out of a hundred for special skills that needed consultation.</p>
<p>If we only block the initial gathering for now, it would also not overheat from then on.
And the Association’s Awakening Centers will keep restricting the number of people to a thousand.
Please tell them to keep to the official public holidays and to stick to the 5 o’clock work ending hour.
No, please give them a 10 to 4, with about a two hour lunch time.
It was a sinecure.</p>
<p>In order to do so, you’ll have to throw something at the Association too.
I am sitting in a place where there is a large transient population.
I will find and bring them high rank Hunters.
I can also fish out special skills that could have disappeared if they went to the normal Awakening Centers.
How appealing is that, even just looking at me? Should I also go abroad on business trips sometimes? If I give this much, it seems like I should get something back.
Magic beast rearing skill.
I didn’t actually have it, but if another one like this appeared, it would outshine new S-Ranks.
And what about Myeongwoo? An incredible gem could be hidden among the F-Ranks that would be cursorily Awakened, and would disappear in vain.
I would be choosing to suffer and find those for them.</p>
<p>If the government and the Association have their heads screwed on right, should they not give a PSA saying ‘please visit the special Awakening Center first’, instead?
That is also so.
com Sung Hyunjae quietly laughed.
Yoohyun gave an earth-shaking sigh.</p>
<p>Good.
There will be rake-offs too.
Especially the overseas business trips are alluring.
That is too dangerous.
Yoohyun frowned and continued speaking.
I also thought that going as far as abroad was going too far.
While I was speaking, it became excessive.</p>
<p>Please be satisfied with dividing the country’s Awakened People’s information.
By taking it by dates.
Are you saying to put it up to luck? Anyways, it seems like we have to set a date and discuss it, but I wonder if there is a way to leave out Breaker and Hanshin.
He was a greedy ahjussi.
For me, it would be better to involve both of them.</p>
<p>Ah, and I am thinking of making one of the costs for raising a familiar, be including a sponsorship for low rank Hunters.
Of course within the country, but also overseas.
Both of them had taken aback expressions.
It wasn’t like I was going to pack up and take money even when I was dead, and I was saying I would be making some welfare instead of the reward I should be getting, so what.
Even with just getting proper training and being well equipped with equipment, the people who would die would have their lives saved.
com There was no reason to not do something that wasn’t hard to do.</p>
<p>Follow me back too, boss!In the middle of the night, the Dokkaebi popped out.</p>
<p>This is a present!The thing that was held out along with the cheerful voice, was an animal doll for some reason.
With red fur, looking similar to a fox, and with a golden horn added… Peace? 
That’s the 30cm normal edition, and mine is the 50cm limited edition!Normal edition or limited edition or whatever, exactly what was this? Looking at the tag, it seemed like they had bought it in Japan.</p>
<p>Is this possibly…
It’s cute, but why did you buy it in Japan? Making dolls as you wish and selling them, is that okay?
They were selling it as a baby Horned Flame Lion doll, but it’s a weak excuse~.
If you insisted it was a monster doll, then there wasn’t anything I could say, but Japanese guys were really… Like this, they would make Chirpie dolls and sell them too.
Advertisements At the Dokkaebi’s nagging to follow back, I went into that guy’s social media account.
On the first display, I saw a photo taken wearing a bear doll mask.</p>
<p>……Di<em>ney Land?
I couldn’t go to Uni</em><strong>sal Stu</strong>**!No wonder, I was thinking they were late; so they had done a ton of sightseeing before coming back, huh.</p>
<p>It seems like you had fun.
com for the best novel reading experience The Dokkaebi held out the tablet.
Looking at their social media, it seemed like they had done the work in their spare moments in between playing.
Still, when I checked, it was full of data.
Even the number of dungeons they had investigated was quite a lot.
That’s right, it was good to do the work you had to do well and play well.</p>
<p>So that’s Chirpie! Sticky rice cake!-Chirp! 
The glutton sticky rice cake that’s dating a magic stone bottle! Ta-da, look at this!-Chirp chirp chirp chirp!! Hm? Why was Chirpie suddenly making a fuss… when I took my eyes off the tablet and turned my head, I saw the Dokkaebi holding out a piece of a magic stone to Chirpie.
The color of the magic stone was silver.
A-Rank magic stone.</p>
<p>Hey, wait!-Cheep!!Advertisements As soon as it heard my voice, Chirpie hurriedly took the magic stone piece and swallowed it.
Don’t give that to it!
Why? It’s eating it well.
Is boss possibly starving the sticky rice cake?-Chirp! Chirpie cried as if replying, and received and ate the remaining magic stone.
That brat.
I quickly held Chirpie up and inspected it.
There was no change in the status window and it looked fine outwardly, so it was a relief.</p>
<p>You’re picking up and eating A-Rank magic stones as an F-Rank? What are you going to do if you get sick?-Chirp! 
It’s not chirp.
It might be dissatisfying, but I’m regulating you because I’m worrying about you.
Hm? Monsters’ states aren’t properly known, so we have to be as careful as possible.
We don’t even know the appropriate way to heal you.
-Cheep! As expected, it didn’t understand even a bit.
That’s right, what was I expecting from a kid.</p>
<p>Dokkaebi, you too, you can’t just go around sprinkling magic stones.
And you can’t just recklessly give someone else’s magic beast something to eat.
You have to ask and get permission first before you give anything.
Okay? Not just for Chirpie, but for other monsters, animals, and kids, too.
You talk like my grandmother.
Grandmother? What grandmother.
Could it be that if the keyword gets applied to this guy, continuing from grandfather, I would become a grandmother? Anyways, with this, the preparation to reel in Suk Hayan was complete.</p>

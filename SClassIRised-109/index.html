<p>&lt; Bluebird .  </p>
<p>Myeongwoo!The thought I had as soon as I saw him, was that it was a long time coming.<br />
I had told him to sleep and rest properly every time we passed each other, but he had mumbled that he was okay, and now he became like that! 119[1, no, would calling a healer be better? I put Peace and Chirpie down, and took out my cell phone as I went toward Myeongwoo.  </p>
<p>Are you okay? You’re not hurt anywhere by any chance?First of all, there wasn’t the smell of blood.<br />
Still, there was a chance he was injured when he collapsed, so I didn’t rashly raise him up, and took out a potion.<br />
Maybe he hadn’t lost consciousness, because Myeongwoo let out a dying noise and turned his head a little.  </p>
<p>Mana… potion……So it was a lack of mana, huh.<br />
That was a relief.<br />
When I quickly took out a mana potion and fed it to him, the pale complexion came a little alive.  </p>
<p>Should I get some water for you? Or what about being hospitalized and resting for a few days?I also thought about just forcibly putting him in a hospital.<br />
But even if you tied him firmly to a bed, if he went into the Forge, that was it.<br />
com for a better experience.<br />
…I’m okay.<br />
The mana consumption was more than I had expected… I just didn’t have enough potions….<br />
That freaking ‘I’m okay’!I was sick of it to death.<br />
I supported the still listless Myeongwoo, who was moving limply, and sat him on the sofa.  </p>
<p>Did you eat? When did you last sleep.<br />
I collapsed, so I did sleep a little…?Myeongwoo replied, drinking another mana potion.<br />
Then are you proud of yourself for that, that you’re smiling?.<br />
It’s not like you’re the kind of blacksmith[2 who has mandatory long hours day in and out[3, so why are you voluntarily working yourself to the bone? Make a schedule and stop working at a set time.<br />
And rest on the weekends.<br />
Okay.<br />
For some reason, a reply came obediently unlike usual.<br />
When I searched his expression wondering what kind of change of heart this was, he grinned again.<br />
It was a face that gave me déjà vu.<br />
So.<br />
Did you finish what you were making.<br />
Yeah.<br />
Myeongwoo, who had become perfectly fine at some point, maybe because his recovery had also become better as his rank went up, stood up from his seat.<br />
Then he took an item out from his inventory.<br />
The thing that was revealed was a beautiful sword.<br />
There was a soft blue tint in the transparent blade that seemed like it was made of glass.<br />
It looked closer to decoration than something for actual combat use, but as an item, the strength it held would definitely not be weak.  </p>
<p>You made a weapon.<br />
Ah, because the basic state for a dragon heart is a sword.<br />
…What.<br />
And the design is this one’s preference.<br />
I didn’t know what he was talking about.<br />
Just then, a small bird appeared with a pyorong sound.<br />
It was a round blue-feathered bird that was small enough to be covered by one hand.<br />
com -Cheep.<br />
This one’s preference.<br />
-Cheeeep I understood even less what he was talking about.<br />
I reflexively took the sword that Myeongwoo held out.<br />
[Yoo Eunhye[4 – L-Rank A sword born from a dragon lord as well as great master craftsman Shalos’ magic stone.<br />
……That transparent magic stone you showed me that time, wasn’t SS-Rank, huh.<br />
It came to mind when I saw the transparent body of the sword[5.<br />
The dragon human type’s SS-Rank magic stone was an opaque white.  </p>
<p>Yeah.<br />
It was an L-Rank magic stone.<br />
Specially, it was a magic stone with a particular name of Shalos’ Dragon Heart.<br />
The rank was higher than a normal L-Rank magic stone?Wow… was that so.<br />
Was that so.<br />
Wow, I learned something new.  </p>
<p>That… leaping over ranks just like that, I mean suddenly what L-Rank….<br />
It’s a material with a rank that’s impossible for me to handle with my current abilities, but Ismual is an elemental that Shalos-ssi made.<br />
Thanks to that, I suffered a lot, but I could finish it! For other materials, I can’t handle even SS-Rank well yet.<br />
Still, this time the proficiency went up a lot, so soon, I’ll be able to make low grade SS-Rank items.<br />
Shalos-ssi made him an elemental and gave an L-Rank magic stone, too.<br />
The Forge also seemed to be that person’s, so he really was a giving tree[6.  </p>
<p>It’ll be convenient to transform it into something like a bracelet or ring normally.<br />
At any rate, it doesn’t have any performance as a weapon other than that it will never break.<br />
Even though it was an L-Rank? I should try changing it into a bracelet for now.<br />
As soon as I thought that, it transformed… but the two transparent chains with tons of blue gems dangling from it was disgustingly fancy.<br />
This is a little.<br />
Its preference is like that.<br />
-Cheep The blue bird landed on the back of my hand and tilted its head.<br />
It was made from a dragon heart, but why was it a bird? Was Shalos-ssi a blue dragon?.<br />
Um… Eunhye?-Cheeep.<br />
Can’t it be a little bit more simple?When the blue bird cheeped, just the chains were left and the dandling gems disappeared.<br />
No, one was left.<br />
It cheeped as if saying that it definitely couldn’t get rid of that one at least.<br />
A ring… was a little, you know, and when I changed it to a necklace, a gem necklace that sparkled super blindingly appeared.<br />
Was it a crow instead of a bluebird? Or was it Shalos-ssi’s preference when he was alive? It was well known that dragons liked gems, but was it true for dragons of different worlds? Anyways, a bracelet was better, then.<br />
…Its name really seems like a person’s.<br />
I didn’t name it.<br />
Myeongwoo explained himself, saying that it was decided on its own.  </p>
<p>Currently, it only has one skill.<br />
It’s a damage nullification skill like those previous Shalos’ Beads.<br />
But it’s not 1-time-use, and rank adjustment is possible.<br />
When its full of mana, let’s say when it’s fully charged, it nullifies all of about L-Rank damage for a duration time of 1 hour, more or less, and theoretically no rank limitation like before for about 10 minutes? To charge up the consumed mana, you have to feed it magic stones.<br />
The Shalos’ Bead would’ve been something like a dragon heart fragment, so I had guessed that the skill effect would be similar.<br />
But to think that it nullified L-Rank damage for 1 hour, and could be replenished with magic stones.<br />
That was a scam.  </p>
<p>But it takes quite a while to absorb magic stones, and it has to eat S-Ranks at minimum, so it’ll be better to only use it when it’s necessary.<br />
For S-Rank magic stones, they aren’t hard to find, and how long does it take to absorb.<br />
If you say it’s completely empty, about a week.<br />
That’s not that long! Wow, if an S-Rank Hunter uses this-.<br />
The skill doesn’t get applied unless it’s the contractor.<br />
I had thought it might be so, and it really felt like I was splashed with cold water.<br />
I mean, why? At my upset eyes, Myeongwoo explained, scratching the back of his head.  </p>
<p>If there wasn’t that kind of restriction, I wouldn’t have been able to fit it as an L-Rank… It’s not 1-time-use, and it’s much higher than a simple shielding.<br />
Since it only nullifies damage over a certain amount, and movement is unrestricted.<br />
And the maximum amount is unlimited to rank.<br />
That was so.<br />
But… no, if it was limited to the contractor anyways, then it would be better for it to be applied to me.<br />
Since I also had poison and curse resistance and the doubling skill, too.<br />
It was a really good item.<br />
Now that the duration time had also increased, I should notify the Seseong Guild Leader that my worth had gone up from before.  </p>
<p>It’s a growth type, so other skills or effects can appear from now on, but…Myeongwoo suddenly had a grave face.<br />
I followed suit and my expression became heavy.<br />
Was there something like a side effect?.<br />
Stat integer increase… was impossible.<br />
Even if something is an S-Rank item, stat increase is a sub because it has a separate skill, or if it’s just barely an S-Rank, an integer increase effect is added on.<br />
Integer increase is a little… on the cheap side, should I say? Even if they’re the same rank items, if one is an integer increase, then it’s low quality, something like that.<br />
It’s okay to see it as there aren’t any items at all that are integer increase starting from SS-Rank.<br />
……Is that so.<br />
No wonder it was hard to find S-Rank integer increase items.<br />
There weren’t a lot of people who used it, so I was wondering why I couldn’t see them.<br />
I was a little sad.  </p>
<p>Still, how great is this already? I mean, a damage nullification skill is much more impressive! I just asked for it just in case, but to think that you would make something this perfect.<br />
On top of that, the material, the time…When the surprise over the unexpected item settled down, the feeling of being moved was pushed forward.<br />
At the same time, the bracelet in my hand felt so heavy.<br />
It was excessive, really.  </p>
<p>You could’ve just used it.<br />
In the first place, it was something that was left to you, too.<br />
This much for me-.<br />
Besides that, there’s other things you can say.<br />
Myeongwoo firmly cut off my words.<br />
I flinched and stared at that guy.<br />
It was a face that was proud to the point that light could come out.<br />
It was an expression and eyes that were plenty satisfied.<br />
When I saw that, I remembered what I had to say.<br />
Thanks.<br />
Really.<br />
Don’t mention it.<br />
For real, thank you.<br />
No problem.<br />
Myeongwoo, you’re the best.<br />
You’re impressive.<br />
I also think I’m a bit impressive.<br />
Ah, it really was difficult.<br />
Now, rest while you work.<br />
Please.<br />
Myeongwoo smiled as he nodded his head.<br />
It was a bright and light attitude that seemed like he had taken off a heavy weight.  </p>
<p>Still, don’t go around alone.<br />
You know because you’ve used it before, right? Even if you use a damage nullification skill, there’s no problem with everyday-life-level of contact.<br />
Though in the first place, you wanted a defense ability where contact was possible, so it’s an obvious result.<br />
Yeah, I know.<br />
Since I could be handled however, I would be in a state where I was easy to just grab and run off with.<br />
But there was no cause for me to go around alone, and above all, I liked that there would be nothing that would be dangerous even if I carelessly went into a dungeon .<br />
Now, Yoohyun should worry less, too.  </p>
<p>Eunhye, take care of me from now on.<br />
-Cheep The blue bird that had landed on my wrist replied.<br />
Just then, I noticed Chirpie, who was sitting blankly at my feet.<br />
It seemed like it had received some shock.<br />
What was it? Did it realize that the magic stone it had aimed for had turned into an item?.<br />
Chirpie?-…Chirp Was it looking at the bracelet… no, the bird? Just then, Eunhye flapped down in front of Chirpie.<br />
Chirpie, who had jumped up, shouted strangely combatively.<br />
com for a better experience -Cheep cheep cheep -Chirp chirp! And then, Chirpie started to flap its small wings.<br />
Persistently, to the point of being pitiful.<br />
The blue bird looked at Chirpie being like that, and flew back up to my wrist.<br />
Then it disappeared as if seeping into the bracelet’s gem.<br />
Was that why it left one gem? -Chirp… cheep.<br />
Oh, Chirpie! Why’re you crying!From the small and black eyes, water droplets that were bigger than the eyes themselves fell sadly.<br />
Even when I quickly held it and soothed it, it kept on chirping and crying.  </p>
<p>What’s the matter, why?-Chirp, chirp It chirped, and flapped its wings again.<br />
…Was it crying because it couldn’t fly? It didn’t pay attention to Blue or Comet flying, but was it because it saw a bird like it? But Chirpie’s wings were too small compared to its body.<br />
It was mostly fluff, and it didn’t even have proper wing feathers.<br />
…Hey, Myeongwoo.<br />
Yeah.<br />
If you happen to have time, could you make just one flight item for Chirpie? It can just be something like slowly floating around.<br />
Alright.<br />
If it’s that much, then I’ll make it quickly.<br />
Him readily replying was really reliable and made me thankful.<br />
How do I live without you, really.  </p>
<p>Now you should set up an item workshop properly.<br />
After soothing Chirpie, I ate dinner with Myeongwoo for the first time in a while.<br />
The side dishes made ahead of time were delicious of course, but the ones cooked directly were to the point of provoking admiration.<br />
I automatically thought of Yoohyun and Yerim, but Myeongwoo didn’t particularly like either of them, so I suppressed it.<br />
Yerim did carefully take some side dishes, but I would be sorry to Myeongwoo if I involved Yoohyun, too.<br />
That Yoohyun, you should treat Myeongwoo gentler.<br />
Though it was bad starting from the first impression.  </p>
<p>I felt it while I was making Eunhye, but this thing called the system seems like it’s dragging people down.<br />
You know using skills inside the Forge is different from outside.<br />
Status windows don’t pop up either.<br />
And Yoojin, you seem like you already knew it.<br />
Ah, I also had matters where I got free from the system.<br />
Above all, a lot of it was thanks to the memories of the lizard owner guy.  </p>
<p>Especially skill explanation windows, you can’t believe them just the way they are.<br />
How should I say it, if it’s an ability that can set fire, it just has ‘it can burn something’.<br />
Even though you can cook food, or avoid cold, or brighten darkness, etc.<br />
And there are explanations that aren’t exact.<br />
Not only that, the things called skills are my abilities in the first place.<br />
Myeongwoo nodded his head and spoke.  </p>
<p>If you use them with skill windows, it does work, but since the windows don’t pop up, the feeling is completely different.<br />
Above all, an L-Rank item is something I definitely can’t make within the system.<br />
But after combining strengths with Ismual and understanding the trick to handling mana, it was possible.<br />
Should I say that I broke free of the decided skills?To think that he had already realized that.<br />
That Myeongwoo really was impressive.<br />
I also somehow used Diarma’s abilities, but it would’ve been impossible if I didn’t have the memories and that guy’s magic stone.  </p>
<p>So I’m thinking of trying to train people who don’t have item production skills, but have the talent.<br />
Training them?”Advertisements.<br />
Yeah.<br />
Instead of making items by myself, wouldn’t it be better to form a team? First, I was going to give an offer to Haeyeon’s Lee Minsuk ahjussi.<br />
He only has repair skills, but that’s also an ability for handling items.<br />
And he has much more real life experience than me.<br />
Teaching the skill.<br />
In worlds without the system, that was standard procedure.<br />
The method of taking in disciples with talent, and teaching them special abilities, making them familiar with it.  </p>
<p>It might be possible if it’s inside your Forge.<br />
I’ll also find people with related aptitudes for it and send them to you.<br />
It’s not certain, so if I succeed.<br />
Ah, and while you’re out, let’s go raise our levels.<br />
How many days was it since I used the My Brat skill? A long time had passed.<br />
At my words, Myeongwoo nodded his head, saying he was free now.<br />
While we were going, should I bring Yoohyun? They could also become a little friendlier.<br />
I didn’t know if he had named the elemental.<br />
[1 the emergency phone number, like 911 in the u.<br />
s.<br />
com for a better experience [2 yj just says ‘black’, the eng word transliterated into krn, so based on context, I’m assuming he means ‘balcksmith’? [3 a common way of saying ‘every day of the week’ in krn is listing the days out in a row sort of like this: montueswedthursfrisatsun.<br />
But in this case, yj says montueswedthursfrimonmon, which, as far as I can tell, is a slang sort of way of saying you don’t really have weekends because they also feel like mondays.<br />
So I just tl’d it to ‘[working day in and out’ bc that seemed the easiest day to convey that [4 eunhye is a word that means ‘favor, kindness’ or ‘[god’s grace’ but it can be a name, too.<br />
Since it looks like a name, I wrote it with the ‘Yoo’ and ‘Eunhye’ separated as names are in eng, but in krn, there’s no space, as it also is for names in krn.  </p>

<p>&lt; Even If You Said to Rest (3) .<br />
Kang Soyoung joined us at the cafe I was dragged to after lunch.<br />
A bingsu[1 that was wrapped in layers of mangoes, a puffy pancake, a waffle with fruit and ice cream on it, cheesecake, tiramisu, and other various things filled the table.<br />
Could this be all eaten?.<br />
Noah-ssi, can’t I try riding you just once?Kang Soyoung asked with sparkling eyes.<br />
Noah, with a spoon in his mouth, was bothered and glanced sideways at me sitting next to him.<br />
It seemed like Kang Soyoung was being burdensome.<br />
Though if you put them side by side and looked at them, they really seemed to suit each other.<br />
…Wait, then what about Yoohyun? It wasn’t that Kang Soyoung was romantically interested in Noah, but with goodwill formed, you couldn’t tell how it would develop.<br />
Did I have to disrupt them? Hm, since for now, Noah seemed like he was reluctant about Kang Soyoung.  </p>
<p>Noah-ssi is not a kiseungsu.<br />
It is difficult if you keep being like this.<br />
Kang Soyoung apologized and slightly bowed her head.  </p>
<p>There is also Comet, so I cannot be like this even more, but he will not leave my sight.<br />
I want to see it in person, too.<br />
Truthfully, I also want to try riding-.<br />
Please just eat the bingsu instead.<br />
Noah-ssi, try this.<br />
It is tasty.<br />
Yes.<br />
Maybe because of the two people who kept on aiming for him and sending heated gazes, Noah was timidly hunched over.<br />
Be reasonable about it, you people.  </p>
<p>Kang Soyoung-ssi, do you happen to remember when the Seseong Guild Leader changed his way of speaking?I asked Kang Soyoung in order to check accurately.<br />
For Moon Hyuna, she didn’t meet Sung Hyunjae often, so it could’ve been that it was two months or more since he changed his way of speaking.<br />
At my question, Kang Soyoung tilted her head.  </p>
<p>Ah, thinking of it, he changed it.<br />
When was it? Was it about one and a half months ago? It seems like it was not as much as two months… It should have been about a few days before Yerim was recognized as an S-Rank.<br />
……It was exactly when I regressed.<br />
Of course, it could be a coincidence.  </p>
<p>Were there any other changes besides that? Have you heard the reason why he suddenly changed his way of speaking.<br />
The reason? Would there be a specific reason? He is incredibly natural at it.<br />
com Kang Soyoung stretched out the last word and stared straight at me.  </p>
<p>I am worried because he seems to be a little, quite interested in Han Yoojin-nim.<br />
Excuse me.<br />
Guild Leader seems to be having fun, but there have not been many times where that kind of interest ended well.<br />
Truuuthfully, our Guild Leader does not have a good personality, as you know.<br />
But he is extremely generous to Han Yoojin-nim.<br />
I was quite surprised yesterday, too.<br />
It was possible for him to come since an unusual dungeon appeared, but he even went on a clothes errand for you.<br />
And you seem that close.<br />
We are not close.<br />
No, we will pretend to be close limited to a week.<br />
There were 6 days left now.<br />
Kang Soyoung fiddled with her fork and her eyes slanted down.  </p>
<p>This time especially, he seems to be having more fun, so… even if just for our Comet, it would be good if you be careful.<br />
That’s true.<br />
Putting aside your younger brother, it’s dangerous to treat Sung Hyunjae unhesitatingly as well.<br />
It seemed like Yerim was worried over it, too.<br />
Be careful, if at least for our Blue.<br />
Was it ‘our Blue’ already? Continuing on from Moon Hyuna, even Noah nodded his head.<br />
com for a better experience.<br />
That is right.<br />
I also think that you need to be careful of the Seseong Guild Leader.<br />
I got that you were worrying, but even if you told me to be careful, would I be able to do anything about it? ‘Since it’s a situation where I’ll have to approach him first.<br />
’ If it were up to me, I also wanted to only see that person’s face on TV.<br />
The bingsu was tasty.<br />
The milk ice was really soft.<br />
Rain glided down following the cafe’s large glass window.<br />
Between the low noise of the rain, various conversations and laughs came and went.<br />
Of course Noah, but even I was the type that listened, so it wasn’t bad.<br />
Moon Hyuna and Kang Soyoung lived enjoyably, huh.<br />
I was happy that Yerim was placed among them.<br />
Wouldn’t Yoohyun also have one or two friends? …Did he not have any? Since their ages were similar, should I ask Noah if he would be friends with my brother? It was good that he was doing well, but truthfully, if you were twenty, shouldn’t you be having a fun campus life? Why was he working in dungeons?.<br />
Noah-ssi, do you not have plans on going to school.<br />
School?Noah tilted his head, and Kang Soyoung shouted ‘ah’.<br />
com for a better experience.<br />
I am going to be going to college through special admission next year, but do you want to go together? Though we probably would not take many classes.<br />
What about Han Yoojin-nim? You are B-Rank, but the effects of your skills are great, so it would be possible.<br />
Why college all of a sudden now? And there weren’t a lot of colleges with high rank Hunter special admission, so if I wasn’t careful, I could become my brother’s hoobae[2.<br />
Though I hadn’t ever seen Yoohyun go to school, so we probably wouldn’t run into each other.<br />
I shook my head no, but Moon Hyuna also egged me on.  </p>
<p>At any rate, even if you cut all your classes, you still get a diploma if you substitute it with dungeon attacks, so just go.<br />
There’s nothing bad about having the label of a college grad.<br />
No, if it’s a position like yours, then it’ll be much more comfortable to have it.<br />
Hearing that I didn’t need to take classes, it was slightly tempting.<br />
There was still a lot of time left until next year, so should I think about it? If I go, I should go to a different college than Yoohyun.<br />
Bbiii- Just then, cell phones abruptly rang.<br />
Not just the ones of us four, but all of the cell phones in the cafe let out a sharp sound.<br />
It was a message about a dungeon-related disaster.  </p>
<p>Did one burst open somewhere or something?Moon Hyuna took out her cell phone as she stood from her seat.<br />
I also checked my phone.<br />
It was a message about restricted passage and caution over approaching some sections because of a high rank Hunter going wild.<br />
It was something that happened rarely right after a dungeon attack, but it was somehow suspicious.<br />
When I went into the portal site just in case, the breaking news popped up.<br />
…These crazy guys.<br />
At my unconscious mumbling, Moon Hyuna also put on an agreeing expression.  </p>
<p>Saying that the Haeyeon Guild Leader destroyed a portion of the new Hunter Association building because of friction with the Association.<br />
The Association is coming forward more unhesitatingly than excepted.<br />
They are probably going all out.<br />
It seems like I should go over first.<br />
You said you were on vacation.<br />
And hyung-nim, your brother might not be here.<br />
Moon Hyuna said significantly.<br />
It was as she said.<br />
In the view of the photo, there was fire on a part of the building, but that much was a sight that could be easily made even without Yoohyun.<br />
It would’ve been different if it was a sudden disaster out of the blue.<br />
Fire was common.  </p>
<p>If it is a false charge, I will not be able to leave them alone anymore, isn’t that so? And it is no hardship to go see my brother.<br />
Should I go with you.<br />
Rather than that, please contact Yoohyun.<br />
My phone is not connecting.<br />
com for the best novel reading experience.<br />
Yes.<br />
Of course I will help.<br />
Since traffic was being regulated, it would be faster to fly.<br />
And if Noah was next to me, the possibility of it becoming dangerous was low.<br />
Even if just the poison was sprayed, most would not be able to approach.<br />
I sent one text and went outside the cafe.<br />
Then Noah changed into his dragon appearance.<br />
The passersby were startled, and a few threw away their umbrellas as they ran away in shock.<br />
I felt sorry.<br />
There were some people among them who weren’t shocked, and they took out their phones to film.<br />
When I went up onto Noah’s back, the long wings spread out as we went up into the air.<br />
Thanks to the rain, the scales were more slippery than usual, so it was unstable.<br />
Still, I was a little reluctant to fit a saddle on a person.<br />
If I fell, he would probably catch me.<br />
And I had Eunhye.<br />
As the buildings passed by, I made a call.<br />
A voice that I hadn’t wanted to hear for a day, replied even before I asked.<br />
[I don’t know the young master’s whereabouts either.  </p>
<p>Really?[I’m thankful you evaluate me highly, but even I can’t know everything on the spot.<br />
Besides that, it looks like you’re doing something reckless again.  </p>
<p>If you are worried, why don’t you personally come out? The helicopter looked good.<br />
com [I’m sad because it seems like Han Yoojin-gun thinks of me so lightly.<br />
If you want help, come directly and politely ask.  </p>
<p>I suppose you have found a better item than me in the meantime?[If I did, Han Yoojin-gun would already be in front of me.<br />
There’s no need to respect the secondary one.  </p>
<p>It is extremely fortunate that I am the most amazing.<br />
He spoke like it was a joke, but it wouldn’t be a joke.<br />
Maybe he had heard the contents of the call, but Noah turned to look back at me worriedly, and I pacified him saying it was okay.<br />
If there was someone else in the world whose skill window was as weird as mine, then it was something to complain to god about.<br />
‘It seems like he won’t be active, but he probably wouldn’t act like he doesn’t know to the end.<br />
’ If more debt was piled on, I should consider not paying it back and running off.<br />
I wondered if I should contact Do Hamin, but I remembered that Yoohyun broke his cell phone.<br />
He said that his wallet was lost while he was going around the dungeon with Peace, so he would’ve had his Hunter license and driver’s license newly issued.<br />
-It is that, correct? At Noah’s words, I put away my cell phone, and turned my head.<br />
A bit away, I saw a building where smoke was rising.<br />
The new Association building next to the Awakening Center.<br />
Maybe it was a waste to break the original building, because only a portion of the 2-story annex attached next door was collapsed.<br />
Because of the continuously falling rain, the fire was also mostly put out and only smoke poured out.<br />
com ‘How petty.<br />
’ If Yoohyun had really run wild, even the main building would be caved in.<br />
The breaking news photo was taken well, really exaggeratedly.<br />
I belatedly felt heated up as I sent a text.<br />
It wasn’t that far of a distance from here, so she would arrive soon.<br />
[Will you break the Awakening Center a little? The round building.<br />
I will take responsibility.<br />
Just then, a helicopter approached.<br />
An armed man who looked like a Hunter gestured at us to go down, but I ignored it and took photos and videos and sent them to Suk Simyeong.<br />
-Is it okay to break the helicopter?.<br />
Not yet.<br />
Let’s go down first.<br />
We went down to the front of the collapsed building and I took a proof picture so that my face appeared.<br />
I also took a video, saying that it didn’t seem like my brother was here.<br />
In the meantime, maybe they were interfering with communication, because I couldn’t send it to Haeyeon, but it should be fine as long as my phone was.  </p>
<p>Han Yoojin-ssi.<br />
A man in a black suit tried to approach, but met the vicious gaze of Noah, who had released the entire dragon transformation, and froze.<br />
I came here, thinking to see my loving brother’s face, but do you know where he is?I could not see him.<br />
Even though articles definitely came out saying that he was here.<br />
I asked with a smiling face, but the returning gaze was cold.<br />
That was too much.<br />
In the meantime, the number of people encircling the surroundings increased.<br />
So they wouldn’t feel suspicions, I quickly checked just their ranks.<br />
Three A-Ranks, and the rest were B or lower.  </p>
<p>You cannot be here.<br />
Please come with us.<br />
I have something I am curious about, but are there people inside that building.<br />
All of them were evacuated.<br />
As it came out in the breaking news, the Haeyeon Guild Leader, Hunter Han Yoohyun-.<br />
So where’s my brother?That he merely broke a bit of a wall and stopped – be reasonable about your nonsense.  </p>
<p>He is in the middle of escaping.<br />
Are you seriously crazy.<br />
It is your younger brother’s matter, so I understand that it will be hard to accept.<br />
First, let us move locations, and I will tell you in detail.<br />
Tell me in detail? The way I see it, all of the buildings here seem like they collapsed down.<br />
Excuse me.<br />
Of course, it’s not something my brother did.<br />
Because a dungeon that wasn’t found in time nearby, burst open.<br />
The faces facing me were puzzled, as if asking what I was saying.  </p>
<p>I guess you guys can’t see it yet.<br />
A giant black dragon.<br />
Instead of those guys, Noah flinched and searched around the surroundings.<br />
The idiots still had expressions like they didn’t know what was happening.  </p>
<p>You petty bastards.<br />
If you were going to put out an article saying that the Haeyeon Guild Leader ran wild-.<br />
com Kwagwagwang!! An explosive sound that smacked into one’s ears rang out.<br />
As if I was waiting for it, I didn’t even bat an eye and continued speaking.  </p>
<p>You should make this much of a mess.<br />
Even without turning my head, I could guess what those guys were looking at, by just the dazed faces.<br />
I continued to hear the sound of the building collapsing and rocks falling down.<br />
And.<br />
-Keureureureu A fierce growling shook the air.  </p>
<p>Sh-shit! It’s a dungeon break.<br />
Dragon type; it’s at minimum an A-Rank dungeon.<br />
com An S-Rank dragon type appeared, so it would be dangerous if unimportant people ran wild.<br />
Noah threw himself at the Hunters running away.<br />
Then, one by one, the Hunters lost consciousness and fell.<br />
The movement was so fast, that to my low stat eyes, it looked like a golden wave.<br />
After asking him to check if there were more people around, I drew back.<br />
The black curse and poison dragon that was sitting on the ruins of the Awakening Center stretched out her neck toward me.<br />
The Awakening Center building was lost, so I would be able to extend my vacation a little.<br />
-Darling, it’s fun for me, but is it okay?.<br />
Of course it’s okay.<br />
Since I handled a dungeon break for them, wouldn’t I receive thanks from the Association?‘The Haeyeon Guild Leader went wild’ was a false report.<br />
The fainted idiots and the traces of a giant dragon would be proof.<br />
The people who knew about Riette might be suspicious, but if we played innocent, then that was it.<br />
Where did the gate of the dungeon that burst go? Just yesterday, one disappeared, so one could disappear today, too.  </p>
<p>Since they said there aren’t any people, please push down the building next door as well, wicked dragon-nim.<br />
Cleanly.<br />
-Anytime, princess! I’m paying the price for you to raise the kid with this~.  </p>
<p>I will put my heart and soul into taking care of it.<br />
com Along with husky laughter, the dragon raised her body on her hind legs.<br />
The tail hit the ground, and the scales of two hind legs shook all at once.<br />
Eujijik, right after the ground let out a groan at the powerful pressure.<br />
Advertisements Kwa-ang!! With a short and thick boom, the dragon’s body rammed into the building.<br />
The glass windows burst simultaneously.<br />
Without time to appreciate the sparkling scattering pieces, the lofty building split.<br />
The building that was made of a tough steel skeleton and concrete broke easily and fell like a sugar sculpture.  </p>
<p>Please be careful.<br />
Noah, who had come over at some point, pulled me back and hit the building debris that were bouncing over with his arm.<br />
Riette stomped on the remaining chunks with her large feet and crushed them.<br />
She did well.<br />
I felt all refreshed.  </p>
<p>Dungeon breaks really are dangerous.<br />
It is incredibly fortunate that an S-Rank Hunter, Noah-ssi, happened to be here.<br />
Whatever the blinking Noah had thought, he smiled slightly.<br />
Rain kept on falling.<br />
Around the time I was getting worried over catching a cold even though it was summer, cars appeared.<br />
Several ones.<br />
Ambulances were mixed in.<br />
Among the people who came out, I saw Yoohyun, too.<br />
My brother came over and held an umbrella over me.<br />
Why’re you here getting hit by rain.<br />
Look at how it looks here.<br />
There’s no place to avoid it.<br />
You should’ve taken care to bring an umbrella.<br />
While we were idly chatting about things that didn’t suit the surrounding scene, the hands that were taking care of the fainted Hunters were busy.<br />
I felt a gaze piercing me and turned my head.<br />
It was Song Taewon.<br />
That person also didn’t have an umbrella.<br />
When I smiled welcomingly, the face that was wet with rain stiffened.<br />
It was during my vacation, but it was an atmosphere like I couldn’t not make time for him.  </p>

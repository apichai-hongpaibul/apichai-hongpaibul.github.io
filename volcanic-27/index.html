<p>Editor: Imagine
The Murim Association was about to get defeated in Kaiyan and get Weng An taken but they managed to get out victories with the help of reinforcements.
The help of the Fourteenth Gallant Sword was especially big. The prestige of Gu Pung spread in Kang Ho not long after. With the help of reinforcements they had attained victory successfully and returned to Weng An. Each one of them couldn’t hold their surprise when they arrived at the place.
“Wh, what is…” They imagined people could receive them in the gates when the notices of their victory spread.
But rather than receiving them, there were traces of blood in the destroyed gates. “No!”
Gu Pung looked for Ju Seo Cheon as soon as he arrived. His complexion looked pale for the first time since he came down from Mount Hua.
But that lasted for only a moment. He let out a sigh of relief when he saw Ju Seo Cheon coming out and greeting him.
“What happened?” Gu Pung asked Ju Seo Cheon.
“I will explain.” The only second rate warrior of Weng An started to explain.
All the important figures like Gu Pung, Zhuge Sak, etc. tilted their heads at the words of the second rate warrior.
And as soon as he finished speaking, people showed disbelief rather than surprise. Zhuge Sak especially like that. “Even if the enemy was all third rate, you successfully subjugated with only a hundred of you?”
It wasn’t weird to not believe in those words.
All the warriors that had left behind in Weng An were third rates, except for one person. Even if they used a formation utilizing the gates, it was impossible to defeat a force that had fifty times more numbers.
“It was all thanks to young master Ju. No, great master Ju.”
The second rate warrior added.
Zhuge Sak glanced at the warrior and then became angry.
“You! Won’t you speak properly! Everyone here knows that he is only twelve, who are you trying to take for a fool!” The warrior flinched at Zhuge Sak’s shouting. “Tw, twelve?” The only figure that didn’t know about the kid, Mak Won Gap, raised his head while he was tied down with ropes.
“It, it’s the truth!”
“That’s right great master. We saw it clearly with our eyes.” The other warriors took courage and stepped in.
‘We have to repay the grace we received from great master Ju.’
His nickname had changed into “great master” in no time.
It was a battle that they thought nobody would be able to survive. Everyone was ready to lose their lives.
A despairing situation that had no hope at all got completely overturned with Ju Seo Cheon appearing.
No one had died, and even though some suffered minor injuries, none of them took any substantial injuries. The warriors that received Ju Seo Cheon’s help protected him from the gratefulness that surged from deep within.
Zhuge Sak lowered his voice and mumbled as it wasn’t only one or two people defending him, but all the warriors in Weng An.
“Hm, indeed. You said that there were only third rate warriors in the River of Death and in addition you didn’t annihilate them but half of them got scared and fled in fright. If it’s that, it’s understandable. That’s nothing impressive.” Zhuge Sak put an uninterested expression in no time.
“Yes. And don’t I have more internal energy than other kids my age? That was of great help.” Ju Seo Cheon added some words to evade needless suspicion.
“Great master…
The warriors of Weng An put on unsatisfactory expressions as the evaluation of their benefactor decreased
.
‘It’s not time to appear yet.’
He had called out his name in the battle but that was because he could plentily take care of the after effects.
It was a battle between third rate anyways. Even if he attained complete victory, he wouldn’t receive any great evaluations because of the low level of the fight.
Ju Seo Cheon expected that and ran wild.
“But you are still impressive. You have done well.” Gu Pung complimented Ju Seo Cheon with a proud face.
‘I have seen him since long ago but his insight and calmness isn’t normal at all. Although his martial arts is average. Everyone at that age would get stiff at their first battle but he didn’t get bewildered at all and fought calmly while leading the warriors.’
Gu Pung thought inwardly.
Ju Seo Cheon had hidden his abilities well and nothing about his real power got revealed because of this situation.
However, Gu Pung placed focus on Ju Seo Cheon’s ability to command or his composure and not his martial arts as he hadn’t known the extent of them.
‘He will become a great leading figure.’
A smile spread in Gu Pung’s face.</p>
<hr />
<p>Four days later.
The group returned after the battle of Weng An and Kaiyan.
News about the battle spread instantly. However, only news about the battle of Kaiyan spread because it was of a bigger scale than the battle in Weng An. It wasn’t that it didn’t get mentioned at all, it got buried by the others.
“Hahaha!” The laughter of Shin Do Gyun resonated.
Today, a great feast opened up in Kaiyan. It was a feast celebrating their complete victory.
They almost suffered great losses in the forces they dispatched in Kaiyan and almost got their territory taken by the enemy.
But fortunately, they came out victorious without much damage thanks to the reinforcements of the Fourteenth Gallant Sword and to top it off Three Headed Mad Dog had also died.
The corners of his lips curved until it reached his ears.
“I’m saying this one more time, but you have really done a good job. I was so happy when I heard the news that I didn’t think of my face and danced in the streets. There’s plenty of food and alcohol so enjoy!”
There were no geishas as Jang Seo Eun and Zhuge Suran were alo attending. Instead, women attendants poured them alcohol or served food.
“Wow, young brother. I’m seeing you in a new light!” Jang Hong laughed magnanimously and patted Ju Seo Cheon’s back.
“It’s nothing compared to you, fellow brothers.” Ju Seo Cheon lowered himself and praised Jang Hong.
Jang Hong and Jang Seo Eun had shown good skills for it to be their first real battle.
They didn’t get greatly injured because they were protected by the guards that departed with them from Kae An and could accumulate experience safely.
“No need to be modest brother. It seems like we underestimated your skills. Jang Seo Eun also complemented Ju Seo Cheon sincerely.
But the results may have been different if Jang Hong and Jang Seo Eun didn’t stand out and only Ju Seo Cheon’s performance was spread.
“Thank you.”
Ju Seo Cheon also replied formally today.
Zhuge Sang and Zhuge Suran approached him and congratulated him.
“You are really great young master Ju.” “Congratulations.” Curiosity appeared in the eyes of Zhuge Sang and he could feel uninterest from Zhuge Suran.
“No, hyung-nim. There’s no need to speak so uncomfortably. Isn’t that right fellow brother?” Jang Hong asked Ju Seo Cheon.
“Yes, of course. Treat me comfortably.” Ju Seo Cheon got happy at that.
‘It won’t be bad to form a connection with the siblings in advance. It will certainly be of great help.’
Jang Hong was quite bothersome because he spoke too much but at least for now, he was feeling grateful towards his sociability.
Zhuge Seung Kye was certainly the one he had to care about the most but it didn’t mean that he wouldn’t socialize with these two. “Thank you. I will be in your care.” Zhuge Sang showed his white teeth and saluted.
Ju Seo Cheon got along with the Zhuge siblings and the siblings of the Lotus Peak and conversed with them.
And when they were starting to get drunk with alcohol, he snuck out and approached Zhuge Seung Kye was sitting alone in a corner.
“What is it?”
Zhuge Seung Kye faced Ju Seo Cheon with a taciturn face.
In addition, Zhuge Seung Kye’s performance wasn’t spread.
He also thought that using assassination weapons was a disgrace and requested to keep this a secret as it wasn’t something to be proud of.
Ju Seo Cheon wanted to increase Zhuge Seung Kye’s confidence with this opportunity but it would get bothersome in several ways if it got known that he made an assassination weapon.
“Honestly speaking, we wouldn’t have been able to win in the battle if it wasn’t for my genius younger brother. If you hadn’t been there, I wouldn’t have been able to stay alive.” Ju Seo Cheon sat next to Zhuge Seung Kye.
“It’s really regretful that we can only keep this as a secret but don’t think too bad about it. I will recognize you even when the world refuses to.” Ju Seo Cheon’s tongue moved swiftly and complimented him. It was incomparable from the fellow brothers of the Lotus Peak.
“Ahem, ahem.” It seemed like Zhuge Seung Kye didn’t feel that bad about it that he flushed and coughed. He was certainly a genius but he was still a ten year old kid. He was simpler than he thought.
“I thank you for your compliments but in my position the amazing one isn’t me but you…”
Zhuge Seung Kye had thought of Ju Seo Cheon as being a special person with some abilities.
He knew that members of the Lotus Peak were outstanding but people tend not to believe in things if they don’t see it with their own eyes.
But his perception changed in Weng An. Zhuge Seung Kye was able to realize just how great Ju Seo Cheon was.
‘He is that amazing but gets scorned at saying that he’s the flashy yet frail one, just how amazing are the swordsmen of Mount Hua?’
Zhuge Seung Kye made a misunderstanding.
Even a great senior disciple of the Lotus Peak wouldn’t be able to imitate the swordsmanship he had shown.
Zhuge Seung Kye had no eye for that so he misunderstood on his own.
“Haha,you already realized the greatness of this older brother of yours. But there’s no need to feel so envious. I was just lucky and consumed a miraculous medicine. You will also be able to become like me if you consume one.” Ju Seo Cheon was opening his eyes sharply. His eyes were shining as if they had discovered something.
“A miraculous medicine?”
“Right. No matter how hard it is to understand martial arts, you will be able to solve all of it if you have a miraculous medicine. You will also be able to become an expert in an instant!” Ju Seo Cheon lied without even licking his lips.
“I don’t think that’s true…”
Zhuge Seung Kye mumbled with suspicious eyes.
“Seung Kye, are you more of an expert than me?” “That’s not the case but…” “Have you consumed a miraculous medicine before?”
“That’s not the case either but…” “If you haven’t, don’t speak” Seung Kye felt like he was being tricked.
“Do you think that experiencing that luck at that scale is easy in the first place? If that was the case, Murim would be filled with experts everywhere!”
Zhuge Seung Kye raised his voice as if telling him not to spout nonsense but the only one that heard his voice was Ju Seo Cheon because of the noisy feast.
“Really? What will you do if this brother of yours gets you a miraculous medicine? Coincidentally, I happen to have some information regarding said medicines.” A thick smile spread on Ju Seo Cheon’s face.
Smirk.
Zhuge Seung Kye laughed out loud.
“If that is true I will of course become your younger brother and will even become your underling. Although that will never happen.” “That promise, I hope you keep it.”
Ju Seo Cheon’s mouth curved like a crescent moon. </p>

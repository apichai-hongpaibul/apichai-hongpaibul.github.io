<p>Chapter 150: Dragon Siblings (3) -Mr.<br />
Government Official, isn’t it cheating to threaten me with my pet? You’re a civil servant!.<br />
I’m asking you to act sensibly.<br />
While Taewon Song held a monster prisoner, a request to stop causing damage to the city could hardly be called a threat.<br />
Riette growled, and the jewel snake bit into Taewon Song’s hand in response.<br />
While shiny liquid that looked like poison splattered from its teeth, his black shadow nullified it all.<br />
The small snake twisted its body in anger, and it looked like it had a strong personality like its owner.  </p>
<p>Um, will this be reported to the guild?Soyoung Kang slid quietly from Riette like someone who had been caught drunk driving.<br />
She seemed to have realized that she had gone too far.  </p>
<p>Yes.<br />
I mean, we hadn’t done much yet.<br />
Taewon Song’s eyes looked over the ruined dungeon building and the shattered ground.<br />
The paved roads and precast pavers had disappeared without a trace.<br />
Soyoung Kang frowned at Taewon Song’s quiet but firm gaze.<br />
While Riette had been the main reason, Soyoung Kang was responsible for Riette’s transformation.  </p>
<p>No.<br />
Taewon Song was firm, and I realized how important this guy was.<br />
Who would be able to enforce the law to an A class attacker if not him, and also to an S class? I mean, grabbing an S class hunter’s pet and flashing it in front of her could not be done by anyone.<br />
Riette had been in her dragon form that was adorned with thorns and scales like armor.<br />
An ordinary individual would not be able to say a word.<br />
‘There had been countries where an S class hunter had been a king.<br />
’ If a small country had only one S class hunter, the individual could not be controlled or replaced.<br />
It would be a difficult task to bring a free hunter in this dungeon saturation state.  </p>
<p>Mr.<br />
Yoojin Han!Soyoung Kang targeted me to know after being blocked by Taewon Song.<br />
She walked up to me after I had got down from Noah’s back to a safe place due to a lowered fear resistance and looked up at me with desperate blue eyes.  </p>
<p>Can’t you put in a word for me to the Guild leader.<br />
Yes.<br />
You’re close to him, and I really need that auction ticket! Hyuna has her eyes on that equipment, and I can’t buy it even if I had the money since her priority rankings are higher than me.<br />
It’s an S class equipment for a riding beast, and S class equipment is prioritized to S class hunters.<br />
com An S class equipment for a riding beast? Yoohyun would need it, and Soyoung Kang added a word the moment the thought passed my mind.  </p>
<p>It’s good for flying-type monsters.<br />
So, that was why Hyuna Moon was after it since I hinted at assigning her Blue.  </p>
<p>I’m not close, and how about asking him directly?’.<br />
He does not look over minus points regarding public image management.<br />
The only exception is him.<br />
Soyoung Kang looked sullen.<br />
So, he was the exception.<br />
One thing that large-sized domestic guilds paid the most attention to was the public image management of its high-class hunters.<br />
Them causing trouble outside dungeons rather than inside them was more challenging to control and might become an exploitable weakness.  </p>
<p>Then I won’t be of much help.<br />
I’m not close to him.<br />
Yes, you are.<br />
Stop there, Hunter Soyoung Kang.<br />
Yoohyun spoke coldly as he came up next to me.<br />
He was like ice, and perhaps the rumors I heard before the return might have been false.<br />
Or was it because he was Minyui Kim now? Being friendly as someone else would make things difficult, and being cold would be the right answer now.  </p>
<p>I’ll put in a word.<br />
I smiled at a despondent Soyoung Kang, since making her indebted to me would pay off when I considered her skill.  </p>
<p>Don’t be expectant.<br />
Thank you!Soyoung Kang bowed with a bright smile as if her problem was solved already.<br />
I had said not to be expectant.  </p>
<p>Why are you listening to her whines?Yoohyun spoke in a whisper.<br />
Being involved in another guild’s affairs will not have good results.<br />
I’m only going to be a messenger and take credit.<br />
Hyunjae Sung would not agree to it if he had any sense anyway.<br />
Riette came back to her human form, and her glare sent chills down my spine.<br />
However, Taewon Song did not move a muscle, since sadly, he would have been used to this kind of situation.  </p>
<p>How about fighting after you let go of Velare.<br />
I’ll force you out of this country if you cause any more trouble.<br />
You’re touchy.<br />
Riette laughed sharply, and while her face said she wanted to rush as Taewon Song, she did not move for the jewel snake’s safety.<br />
She must care for that snake more than I had thought, but what use did she have for the beast since she did not need one to ride one? ‘What characteristics did a jewel snake have?’ It had not been seen in domestic dungeons, and I thought I had seen one on a TV special for beautiful beasts.<br />
com for a better experience.<br />
Hey, Pebble.<br />
Riette crooked her neck and looked up to Noah, who was flying above in his dragon form.<br />
Noah raised his scales behind his neck, and his pale gray eyes rolled in tension.  </p>
<p>I’m amazed that you gave a monster I’m raising to someone else.<br />
I had only told you where I hid it just in case.<br />
-…You told me so I can raise it instead.<br />
Noah replied, even as he shuddered.<br />
-You’re too aggressive.<br />
You didn’t even listen as Mr.<br />
Yoojin Han tried to stop you.  </p>
<p>What’s with this sudden nonsense? I have been like this all my life.<br />
-Being used to you does not mean I like your actions.<br />
And I’m Noah and not Pebble.<br />
Riette’s laugh was quiet as Noah spoke with clenched teeth and the end of her foot spun as it crushed the ground underneath.<br />
She flew up in the air.  </p>

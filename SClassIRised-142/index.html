<p>‘I should have brought my clothes to the bathroom.<br />
But you never really do that, especially when the bathroom is connected to your bedroom.<br />
I had a large towel, but it would seem strange to hide my chest.<br />
I did that anyway.  </p>
<p>Can you go out so I can change.<br />
Why?My little brother looked me up and down as if to find the wound.<br />
It was a weird request since I washed him and went to public baths together when we were young.  </p>
<p>I feel like it.<br />
You know, an inferiority complex?It was true that my body was less developed than my precocious little brother.<br />
I had nothing to be embarrassed about, but he was too much.  </p>
<p>You don’t look so.<br />
Anyway, turn around, at least.<br />
Irin, you go somewhere too.<br />
Irin went to Yoohyun, but he did not move a muscle.<br />
I must have raised his suspicions, so I went to the closet using my towel as protection.<br />
I wore my pajama top first, trying not to disturb my wound since his gaze followed me everywhere.<br />
Yerim has gifted them to me, but I had never worn them.<br />
Since everyone couldn’t have used gate stones, did you come alone? What happened to Peace and Yerim? It was an S class dungeon.<br />
I asked, turning around after I finished wearing my pajamas.<br />
I could not help frowning since it meant that Yoohyun had been irresponsible as a Guild leader.  </p>
<p>Yerim Park told me to get out after knowing what was going on, and Peace probably felt the same.<br />
Since the information is reliable and there are experienced guild members with 2 S classes, it would be all right.<br />
Anyway, the dungeon fits Yerim Park’s skillset.<br />
That calmed me down.  </p>
<p>Yerim told you to get out so easily? She would also have tried to come out.<br />
We fixed that peacefully by rock, paper, and scissors.<br />
That was the right decision.<br />
It was nice that they agreed without a fight.<br />
However, Yerim would have been at a physical disadvantage, and her hands might have made it easy for him to know.  </p>
<p>It ended smoothly after you left.<br />
com I took an old phone out of the drawer.<br />
At least I had this since my data probably could not be recovered.<br />
I should have made back up files of the pictures and videos.  </p>
<p>There were no problems.<br />
Yes.<br />
The dungeon break ended well, too.<br />
Yoohyun seemed not to have contacted Hyunjae Sung or others yet.<br />
I sent a text message to Hyunjae Sung while paying close attention to Yoohyun.<br />
[Please don’t say anything to Yoohyun.<br />
The answer came back quickly.<br />
[^^ What was this? What was he trying to do? A simple emoticon made me want to curse.<br />
[Please don’t say anything.<br />
Really.<br />
com for the best novel reading experience I already had convinced Noah and Taewon Song’s phone must be as dead as mine.<br />
He would not say anything if I managed to convince him later.<br />
Therefore, I just needed to sew Hyunjae Sung’s mouth.<br />
I literally wanted to do so.  </p>
<p>Who are you sending text messages to?Yoohyun approached as I received Hyunjae Sung’s reply.<br />
I managed to hastily press the power button as Yoohyun snatched my phone away.<br />
He spoke in a sour voice.  </p>
<p>There had to have been problems.<br />
I’m fine.<br />
Isn’t that all we need.<br />
You seem pale.<br />
I’m tired.<br />
Yoohyun nodded at me, who said I wanted to go to sleep but turned on my phone anyway.<br />
Well, the phone’s locked, so….<br />
com for the best novel reading experience.<br />
You unlocked it in front of me a few times.<br />
I remembered it then.<br />
Why do you remember such things? You can’t just see someone else’s phone without their permission! Give it!I tried to take it away from him to no avail.<br />
I just made myself more tired.<br />
As I caught my breath from that little movement, Yoohyun’s eyes narrowed as he seemed to have checked Hyunjae Sung’s messages.<br />
Damn, everything went to hell.<br />
My spine chilled a bit.  </p>
<p>Hey, chick!Please use your teleport skill for your father.<br />
I heard a peeping noise from the living room and saw him slowly fly to me.<br />
However, my little brother caught me before I could escape.<br />
Well, I also did not know if he could teleport me.  </p>
<p>Hey.<br />
Hyunjae Sung just did some outlandish things again.<br />
He was asking if you were all right.<br />
Huh.<br />
You have a fever.<br />
Did I? I was not aware of it.<br />
Yoohyun checked my body temperature and made me sit on the bed.<br />
The chick sat on my lap.<br />
Hey, can you take your father to another place? But if I disappeared from here, more mayhem would ensue.  </p>
<p>Your body is that of a civilian.<br />
If you push It too far, there will be consequences.<br />
Yoohyun spoke, drying my hair.<br />
I lwas reminded of memories, even though our positions have switched.  </p>
<p>I didn’t do much.<br />
The monsters were at least A class, and you should have escaped instead of jumping in.<br />
Leader Song and Noah should have been more than enough, so you shouldn’t have gone in.<br />
Yeah…that was irrational of me.<br />
I had not needed to act, but I managed to protect civilians from flying poisonous insects and underground monsters.<br />
If I had not served as bait, at least tens of them would have escaped outside the barricade.<br />
We also would have probably lost the baby wolf.<br />
com ‘Should I act as bait from now on if a dungeon breaks?I did not want to, but my conscience will suffer if I ignore them.<br />
I could save so many lives… Damn, at least dungeons are being managed well enough, so there is little chance of breaks happening.<br />
If Hayan Seok manages to develop the gate location seeking device, there will be no more undiscovered dungeon breaks.<br />
Ms.<br />
Hayan, please hurry.<br />
I really do not want more attention as I had more than enough now.  </p>
<p>Turn off the poison resistance for your medicine.<br />
Yoohyun took two pills from the inventory.  </p>
<p>What are they.<br />
Fever reducer and painkiller.<br />
I use them for magic overloads, but they are effective for common fevers.<br />
Aren’t they expensive? We have countertop medicine in the kitchen.<br />
They don’t cost much.<br />
com Yoohyun thinks that a million dollars for a meal is manageable, so I had little comfort.<br />
Medicine relevant to magic used by S class hunters will go at least by millions.<br />
I used a magic potion instead of water to swallow them.<br />
As they were for hunters, the effects showed immediately, and I felt lighter.<br />
I really had a fever as my condition improved considerably.<br />
Also, I began to feel asleep fast enough so I could not turn the poison resistance skill up again.  </p>

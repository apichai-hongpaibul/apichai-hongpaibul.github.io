<p>139 Part 2 I saw a large truck split in two through the cut car door.
Yoohyun Han grabbed me with one arm and obliterated the swinging car door and jumped outside.
I saw how chaotic the road had become when we landed on the collapsed truck that had been diagonally cut in two.</p>
<p>Things become insane so quickly.
I was still flabbergasted, but I was sure that the truck had tried to crush the small car.
It had even targeted the passenger seat, and I had to sigh over the fact this happened the moment I came out with a B class hunter.
The real Minyui Kim was a supporter who would not have been able to protect me properly.
Since I had not been using the grace, I would have at least been seriously hurt, and maybe die on the spot if things had turned out badly.</p>
<p>I know that it was an opportunity hard to ignore, but these guys act fast.
They must have been lying in wait, and my heart began to beat faster due to my lowered fear resistance.
I called Haeyeon instead of Yoohyun, who was searching the truck driver.
I asked them to process the accident and a new car and turned my gaze back to the road.</p>
<p>The driver’s dead.
He is? Yoohyun, I mean, Mr.
Minyui Kim, please help the people still trapped in their cars.
Many cars were swept into this accident because of the size of the truck.
Yoohyun looked like he did not want to do it, but he ran down when I told him I would turn on the grace.
He suddenly came back with an umbrella.</p>
<p>Stay still, so you’re in clear sight.
com He opened the umbrella and made me hold it before going to an overturned car.
I did not care if I got wet; it was summer.
The road situation was soon remedied after Yoohyun began to work.
He easily ripped the dented car doors and rescued others.
I thought it might be dangerous to move the injured, but Yoohyun used mid-class potions whenever necessary.
He pushed the cars blocking the road and made way for the ambulances to come in.
119 and the police came soon, and there was low class awakened mixed in the ambulance workers.
While there were no high-class awakened, there were more than ten mid-class awakened who worked as firefighters around the country.
Most of them had awakened in accident sites and chose to work as firefighters instead of hunters.</p>
<p>Thank you, hunter.
I appreciate your efforts.
Yoohyun exchanged words with the ambulance workers and returned to my side.
His question rang quietly in my ear as we shared the umbrella.</p>
<p>Who might it be? The association?
The auction house might be involved since they would have some grudges against us.
They both had it coming.
However, wouldn’t the auction house still find some value in keeping us alive?
They wiped the entire hotel.
Someone wants revenge.
com Yoohyun made me promise that at least an A class, and preferably an S class hunter would accompany me.
Later on, people from the Haeyeon Guild and the hunter accident department arrived.
I did not see Taewon Song around because it was a simple car accident.
Haeyeon decided to collect the driver’s corpse first after negotiations.
I had not seen Hunter Sunghan Kim for a while, and he now approached us.</p>
<p>Hello, Mr.
Sunghan.
Are you hurt?Sunghan Kim did not say anything after I answered I was not hurt in any way and just took out the driver’s corpse.
While he was friendly and showed his worry, his attitude towards me was more indifferent than before.
‘He had not sent me any medicine or other gifts recently.
’ I looked up my status page and saw Sunghan Kim’s name was still recorded there.
However, there was a definite change in his attitude towards me.</p>
<p>Mr.
Sunghan Kim.
I called him as I got off the truck with Yoohyun’s help.
Yes?
Do you remember saying that I reminded you of your grandfather before?
Ah…yes I did.
Sunghan Kim looked a bit embarrassed as he nodded.</p>
<p>I apologize for surprising you with ungrounded words.
If he was saying that he was sorry, that would mean only one thing.</p>
<p>You don’t think that anymore?
Yes.
I still think there are similar points, but you two are completely different people.
He answered, without any hesitation.
com ‘Was the effect that made him think I was his temporary caretaker?’ However, Yerim, Peace, and the chick acted in the same manner to me.
The difference between them and Sunghan Kim was that I had been neglecting the latter.
The attention had been one way, and we had not met often and had not seen each other recently.
‘So, even if the keyword effect helps me temporarily, I have to work on relationships afterward.
’ It would be too much to receive one-way affection because of a keyword, even if it was an L class title.
The effect seemed to have lasted about two months when I calculated the last time Sunghan Kim sent me presents.
Did others experience a little change? Yoohyun was my brother with or without that title, so I would have to ask Yerim when she comes out.
‘I would have to pay more attention to Ms.
Hyuna.
’ I would have to get closer to her before the keyword effect wore out.
I apologized to Minyui Kim silently for his lost car and arrived at Sesung Guild in a new one.
Soyoung Kang met me and opened her eyes wide when she thought she saw Minyui Kim with me.</p>
<p>This is the first time I met you.
This is Minyui Kim, a B class hunter in Haeyeon Guild.
A B class hunter? Mr.
Han, are you craz-why are you being so careless?!
I trust him.
Where is Sesung Guild Leader?
Please step this way.
Soyoung Kang glanced at Yoohyun with distrust and led us in.
We were inspected and given inventory seal bracelets to wear, but the inside of the building was heavily guarded.
Soyoung Kang stopped walking.</p>
<p>I’m sorry to say that a Haeyeon hunter cannot go on further.
Yoohyun immediately frowned when he heard her words, but Soyoung Kang did not step back.
She told him again that outside parties cannot enter with a rare determination and coldness in her expression.</p>
<p>Mr.
Minyui Kim, please wait here.
But I cannot leave him alone.
I’m not alone.
Ms.
Soyoung Kang is here, and maybe others.
com Something like a little lizard.
I stepped closer to Yoohyun as if to calm him and lightly held his hand.
Irin came over to my hand in the space we kept hidden from Soyoung Kang’s sight.
Irin went to my shoulder and began to rest as a tattoo.</p>
<p>Please wait in comfort.
Yes, take care.
If there is any danger, let’s go with eleven.
Yoohyun must be talking about the contract leftover from the Hong Kong kidnapping.
What was eleven? I should check the memo later.
I affectionately tapped Yoohyun’s shoulder and followed Soyoung Kang to step inside.</p>
<p>Our Guild Leader seemed to be in a bad mood this morning.
Soyoung Kang opened her mouth when only the two of us were left.</p>
<p>He may have had a nightmare or have other thoughts in his mind.
He said to let you in if you wanted to come, but his voice was off.
Soyoung Kang took out a compact portal key, telling me to be careful today.</p>

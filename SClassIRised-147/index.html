<p>139 Part 2 I saw a large truck split in two through the cut car door.<br />
Yoohyun Han grabbed me with one arm and obliterated the swinging car door and jumped outside.<br />
I saw how chaotic the road had become when we landed on the collapsed truck that had been diagonally cut in two.  </p>
<p>Things become insane so quickly.<br />
I was still flabbergasted, but I was sure that the truck had tried to crush the small car.<br />
It had even targeted the passenger seat, and I had to sigh over the fact this happened the moment I came out with a B class hunter.<br />
The real Minyui Kim was a supporter who would not have been able to protect me properly.<br />
Since I had not been using the grace, I would have at least been seriously hurt, and maybe die on the spot if things had turned out badly.  </p>
<p>I know that it was an opportunity hard to ignore, but these guys act fast.<br />
They must have been lying in wait, and my heart began to beat faster due to my lowered fear resistance.<br />
I called Haeyeon instead of Yoohyun, who was searching the truck driver.<br />
I asked them to process the accident and a new car and turned my gaze back to the road.  </p>
<p>The driver’s dead.<br />
He is? Yoohyun, I mean, Mr.<br />
Minyui Kim, please help the people still trapped in their cars.<br />
Many cars were swept into this accident because of the size of the truck.<br />
Yoohyun looked like he did not want to do it, but he ran down when I told him I would turn on the grace.<br />
He suddenly came back with an umbrella.  </p>
<p>Stay still, so you’re in clear sight.<br />
com He opened the umbrella and made me hold it before going to an overturned car.<br />
I did not care if I got wet; it was summer.<br />
The road situation was soon remedied after Yoohyun began to work.<br />
He easily ripped the dented car doors and rescued others.<br />
I thought it might be dangerous to move the injured, but Yoohyun used mid-class potions whenever necessary.<br />
He pushed the cars blocking the road and made way for the ambulances to come in.<br />
119 and the police came soon, and there was low class awakened mixed in the ambulance workers.<br />
While there were no high-class awakened, there were more than ten mid-class awakened who worked as firefighters around the country.<br />
Most of them had awakened in accident sites and chose to work as firefighters instead of hunters.  </p>
<p>Thank you, hunter.<br />
I appreciate your efforts.<br />
Yoohyun exchanged words with the ambulance workers and returned to my side.<br />
His question rang quietly in my ear as we shared the umbrella.  </p>
<p>Who might it be? The association.<br />
The auction house might be involved since they would have some grudges against us.<br />
They both had it coming.<br />
However, wouldn’t the auction house still find some value in keeping us alive.<br />
They wiped the entire hotel.<br />
Someone wants revenge.<br />
com Yoohyun made me promise that at least an A class, and preferably an S class hunter would accompany me.<br />
Later on, people from the Haeyeon Guild and the hunter accident department arrived.<br />
I did not see Taewon Song around because it was a simple car accident.<br />
Haeyeon decided to collect the driver’s corpse first after negotiations.<br />
I had not seen Hunter Sunghan Kim for a while, and he now approached us.  </p>
<p>Hello, Mr.<br />
Sunghan.<br />
Are you hurt?Sunghan Kim did not say anything after I answered I was not hurt in any way and just took out the driver’s corpse.<br />
While he was friendly and showed his worry, his attitude towards me was more indifferent than before.<br />
‘He had not sent me any medicine or other gifts recently.<br />
’ I looked up my status page and saw Sunghan Kim’s name was still recorded there.<br />
However, there was a definite change in his attitude towards me.  </p>
<p>Mr.<br />
Sunghan Kim.<br />
I called him as I got off the truck with Yoohyun’s help.<br />
Yes.<br />
Do you remember saying that I reminded you of your grandfather before.<br />
Ah…yes I did.<br />
Sunghan Kim looked a bit embarrassed as he nodded.  </p>
<p>I apologize for surprising you with ungrounded words.<br />
If he was saying that he was sorry, that would mean only one thing.  </p>
<p>You don’t think that anymore.<br />
Yes.<br />
I still think there are similar points, but you two are completely different people.<br />
He answered, without any hesitation.<br />
com ‘Was the effect that made him think I was his temporary caretaker?’ However, Yerim, Peace, and the chick acted in the same manner to me.<br />
The difference between them and Sunghan Kim was that I had been neglecting the latter.<br />
The attention had been one way, and we had not met often and had not seen each other recently.<br />
‘So, even if the keyword effect helps me temporarily, I have to work on relationships afterward.<br />
’ It would be too much to receive one-way affection because of a keyword, even if it was an L class title.<br />
The effect seemed to have lasted about two months when I calculated the last time Sunghan Kim sent me presents.<br />
Did others experience a little change? Yoohyun was my brother with or without that title, so I would have to ask Yerim when she comes out.<br />
‘I would have to pay more attention to Ms.<br />
Hyuna.<br />
’ I would have to get closer to her before the keyword effect wore out.<br />
I apologized to Minyui Kim silently for his lost car and arrived at Sesung Guild in a new one.<br />
Soyoung Kang met me and opened her eyes wide when she thought she saw Minyui Kim with me.  </p>
<p>This is the first time I met you.<br />
This is Minyui Kim, a B class hunter in Haeyeon Guild.<br />
A B class hunter? Mr.<br />
Han, are you craz-why are you being so careless?.<br />
I trust him.<br />
Where is Sesung Guild Leader.<br />
Please step this way.<br />
Soyoung Kang glanced at Yoohyun with distrust and led us in.<br />
We were inspected and given inventory seal bracelets to wear, but the inside of the building was heavily guarded.<br />
Soyoung Kang stopped walking.  </p>
<p>I’m sorry to say that a Haeyeon hunter cannot go on further.<br />
Yoohyun immediately frowned when he heard her words, but Soyoung Kang did not step back.<br />
She told him again that outside parties cannot enter with a rare determination and coldness in her expression.  </p>
<p>Mr.<br />
Minyui Kim, please wait here.<br />
But I cannot leave him alone.<br />
I’m not alone.<br />
Ms.<br />
Soyoung Kang is here, and maybe others.<br />
com Something like a little lizard.<br />
I stepped closer to Yoohyun as if to calm him and lightly held his hand.<br />
Irin came over to my hand in the space we kept hidden from Soyoung Kang’s sight.<br />
Irin went to my shoulder and began to rest as a tattoo.  </p>
<p>Please wait in comfort.<br />
Yes, take care.<br />
If there is any danger, let’s go with eleven.<br />
Yoohyun must be talking about the contract leftover from the Hong Kong kidnapping.<br />
What was eleven? I should check the memo later.<br />
I affectionately tapped Yoohyun’s shoulder and followed Soyoung Kang to step inside.  </p>
<p>Our Guild Leader seemed to be in a bad mood this morning.<br />
Soyoung Kang opened her mouth when only the two of us were left.  </p>
<p>He may have had a nightmare or have other thoughts in his mind.<br />
He said to let you in if you wanted to come, but his voice was off.<br />
Soyoung Kang took out a compact portal key, telling me to be careful today.  </p>

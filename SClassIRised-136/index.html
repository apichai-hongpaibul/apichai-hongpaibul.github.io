<p>Chapter 136 Out of the Frying Pan into the Fire.<br />
Yes, it’s the Dungeon Break area.<br />
Your guild leader’s car wrecked so we need a new one.<br />
They are asking what type of vehicle they should send.<br />
Do you have any preferences.<br />
You really have all the brandsin your garage.<br />
If they are in the market, yes.<br />
He’s in his own league.<br />
I should ask him to bring a farm cultivator.<br />
Maybe I will, because it will be a sight.<br />
But I asked for anything moderately comfortable since a cultivator would not make a pleasant ride.<br />
I returned the phone to Hyunjae Sung after I ended the call.<br />
My phone died.<br />
While the grace had protected me from direct damage made by Hyunjae Sung’s rampage, indirect damage seemed to be something else.<br />
I needed to find an electricity resistance item since he was the nemesis of all electronic items.  </p>
<p>What was the magnetic thing? Do you do all things that have to do with electricity? Can you charge your phone by yourself.<br />
It’s easier to plug in the phone rather than using the skill while considering voltage and current.<br />
Controlling it is more difficult than you think.<br />
So it was not impossible, and I was curious how precise his control was.<br />
I pondered over what other things were applicable but stopped because I was too tired.<br />
I wanted to go to sleep as my body became as limp as wet cotton.<br />
com I heard something heavy fall.<br />
I opened my half-closed eyes and turned my head to where the noise had come from.<br />
-Mr.<br />
Yoojin! It was Noah.<br />
A golden dragon landed on top of a giant monster I estimated to be an A class Dungeon Boss.<br />
Hyunjae Sung would not need to go to the junkyard since the spot was where the sportscar had been parked.<br />
-Are you hurt anywhere? Noah looked at me being carried by Hyunjae Sung with a worried expression.<br />
While his eyes were soft, his half-open wings and sharp nails were tense as if he would fly at Hyunjae Sung.<br />
However, since the keyword has been applied, Noah’s presence was weaker than Hyunjae Sung or Taewon Song.  </p>
<p>I’m all right, just tired.<br />
-You have a chest wound.<br />
I should have changed my clothes.<br />
Although Noah applied hisB class healing skills, the chest wound did not heal.<br />
Noah looked surprised, and Hyunjae Sung seemed intrigued when only the scratches I earned rolling about the floor healed.<br />
No.<br />
You can specialize in healing.<br />
People are treated with respect with just B class single heal skills.<br />
It’s just that the wound is a special one.<br />
How strange is it?I got goosebumps from him murmuring something to himself.<br />
Please return the fear resistance level to what it was.<br />
-The gate has been settled with this last monster.<br />
We should return.<br />
Noah spoke with his front legs stretched.<br />
I wanted to go home as soon as possible.<br />
– Thank you for your work.<br />
But since we already called a car, we should ride it.<br />
I did not want to ride Noah in this state since it was scary without any safety devices.<br />
Noah would not drop me easily, and I had my grace, but scary things would remain scary.  </p>
<p>Please heal Mr.<br />
Taewon Song if it’s alright with you.<br />
He’s hurt pretty badly.<br />
com Noah inclined his head as if the news was a surprise.<br />
He said that Taewon Song had been against an S class monster but he seemed to be more than a match for it.<br />
I just laughed.<br />
The monster was easy, but there was a person worse than an S class monster.  </p>
<p>Please help.<br />
-I can’t leave Mr.<br />
Yoojin behind like this… His pale gray eyes narrowed and glanced at Hyunjae Sung.<br />
I understood that the situation was an uneasyone, but there was no other choice.  </p>
<p>Guild leader Sung came because I called him.<br />
Don’t worry.<br />
-All right.<br />
Please return safely.<br />
I saw the golden dragon hesitate and then fly to the night sky with outstretched wings.<br />
While he would have potions, Taewon Song would not have used them so easily.<br />
Since the situation has been somewhat cleaned up, he would have done first aid with a low level potion.<br />
My little brother and Hyunjae Sung…He would need at least a high level potion to heal the wounds made by those violent attack skills.<br />
He would ask a healer to ration potions.  </p>
<p>I don’t know why you would have a wound like this.<br />
com Hyunjae Sung had been staring at my chest wound for a while now.  </p>
<p>My hand slid when I was chopping scallions in the kitchen.<br />
You seem to cook with an item that will make a wound unhealable with a B class healing skill.<br />
The scallion was S class.<br />
Can I slice it open?He was not talking about scallions, and I had goosebumps on my arm.  </p>
<p>Are you crazy? You’ll kill me.<br />
I have good control, so don’t worry.<br />
Just let me leave.<br />
I’ll call a cab.<br />
com Cabs would never come up here, and my phone was dead.<br />
I had to look for a phonebooth.<br />
Hyunjae Sung let me out without any complaints.<br />
My legs were weak, but I could somehow stand.<br />
I walked forward, looking for an open convenience store when Hyunjae Sung made me face him with a hand on my shoulder.<br />
I was looking at him with my neck raised from the usual distance, but he seemed to be farther away.<br />
I felt a pang of envy at his height.  </p>
<p>You’re not nice today.<br />
I think not cursing you for asking me to let you slice my chest open was more than enough kindness.<br />
Didn’t you curse.<br />
That was just me facing reality.<br />
Then, kind Yoojin.<br />
He had a scary smile.<br />
I did not run because it would have been a useless attempt.<br />
It might have been better for me to choose a risky flight, but Hyunjae Sung would not have sent me along.<br />
Noah would have ranked below Taewon Song on today’s sacrificial lamb list, and my name would be right below.  </p>
<p>I’m not feeling well lately.<br />
We have been busy.<br />
Hyunjae Sung did not seem to know about Taewon Song’s pillage skills.<br />
He probably knew it as a nullifying skill during battle.  </p>
<p>That’s unfortunate.<br />
I should have paid more attention.<br />
You’re a busy person, and I would appreciate it if you did not give me your attention from now on.<br />
Between us? No.<br />
I should not have called this person.<br />
Little brother, this time, you made a wrong decision.<br />
But he would not have told me to call Hyunjae Sung if he knew that my fear resistance skill level decreased.<br />
I should have told him.  </p>
<p>How did Yoohyun Han come here.<br />
You probably have not heard the news, but the Hayeon Guild leader went to conquer a dungeon.<br />
The fire was merely a gas explosion since someone seemed to have escaped after forgetting to close a gas valve.<br />
Your tongue seems to be light as a feather.<br />
com While Hyunjae Sung was still smiling, I had to wonder where the end of his patience was since he was not a guy used to holding back.<br />
However, I could not answer any of the questions.<br />
I could not tell him Taewon Song’s skill, and I would be crazy to tell him Yoohyun’s.<br />
It was the same for the magic stone in my chest.<br />
Hyunjae Sung spoke as he stared at me after a short silence.  </p>
<p>It can’t be helped.<br />
My knees bent not out of my own accord.<br />
My breath hitched, and everything turned white.<br />
When my shaking vision somehow cleared, I could see my hands on the floor.<br />
The sound of my breathing seemed too far away to be mine.  </p>
<p>Yoojin Han.<br />
Hyunjae Sung lowered his body with one knee on the ground.<br />
He tousled my head like a dog and made me lift my head.<br />
Our eyes met while I was still reeling, and his gaze that pretended to be gentle instilled a deep fear in me.  </p>
<p>Yoojin, you should be telling me the truth.<br />
His sweet whisper came like an absolute command.<br />
The ends of my fingers clawed the floor.<br />
Why were you wounded on the chest.<br />
The magic stone…The magic stone of Diarma.<br />
My head cleared a bit once I remembered it.<br />
Diarma and the Queen of the Mermen.<br />
I remembered what happened at that time.<br />
A cursed poisonous dragon large enough to swallow a star and the ruler of waters.<br />
Damn it, I had gone through almost anything despite being an F class.<br />
I would not bend to this.<br />
While I had lostthe benefits of the fear resistance skill, I still had my experiences under my belt.  </p>
<p>My opponent is only an S class.<br />
I clenched my teeth.<br />
I tried to escape from the chains choking me, but it was not easy.<br />
In fiction, people would somehow break free by sheer will, but reality was bleak.  </p>
<p>Stop resisting and speak.<br />
Then you would be released.<br />
It was a tempting offer.<br />
com I could not do anything about the class difference and therefore had no way out.<br />
My stats were F class and there was a huge gap between Hyunjae Sung and me, and I had no mental resistance items.<br />
F class was useless.<br />
Therefore, only an even higher class could win against a higher class.  </p>
<p>That bastard.<br />
I used magic through breath-taking pressure.<br />
The mental skill of the Diarma was not directed at him.<br />
I could not use it, and it would not be effective unless he accepted it due to class differences.<br />
The skill was addressed to me.<br />
I took only some parts of the skill effects and refreshed my memory of when Diarma and the Queen faced each other and their immense presence.<br />
An S class? That was a pond in front of an ocean.<br />
The ocean attacked the pond and me and swept us away.  </p>
<p>Uh!Damn, I had to be crazy.<br />
I should have chosen Diarma before he became a dragon.<br />
I stopped breathing for a moment.<br />
I slid down on the ground and looked up at Hyunjae Sung with tears streaking down my face.<br />
He looked actually surprised now.<br />
You’re only an S class.<br />
You don’t deserve to see this.<br />
Why are you smiling? Hyunjae Sung picked me up again, and I felt absolutely battered inside.<br />
I wanted my pet.<br />
Hey, your daddy is dying right now.<br />
-Peep!.<br />
…Hey.<br />
It really came.<br />
I gently took the baby bird floating in front of me in my hands.<br />
The soft and warm touch calmed my racing heartbeat.  </p>
<p>So, it does have a teleport skill.<br />
Stop looking at someone else’s pet.<br />
-Peep.<br />
Peep!.<br />
Hey, thank you for coming to me, but it’s too dangerous for you to be out like this.<br />
com It would be difficult for me if the little guy appeared during a battle.<br />
I should educate him so he would not teleport so easily, but I had no idea how to do it.<br />
The car arrived as I fed the little guy magic stones.<br />
The driver immediately came out and opened the back door.<br />
I wanted to fall asleep the moment I sat but I glared at Hyunjae Sung, who sat next to me instead.  </p>
<p>If you have a conscience, please get off.<br />
We will be immediately returning to the guild.<br />
Hyunjae Sung ignored my words and spoke to the driver.<br />
Wait, that guild would not mean Haeyeon?.<br />
Shouldn’t you be taking me back? Do you want me to take a cab.<br />
I can’t leave you like this.<br />
I’ll protect you for the foreseeable future.<br />
Thank you for overestimating an S class.<br />
Please let me out anywhere near a lane.<br />
I did not know whether I could walk, but I would return home if I needed to crawl.<br />
Or if someone would just let me make a phone call to Haeyeon.  </p>
<p>I’m unwell, but I just need to stay at home.<br />
Do you have the right to be worried about me.<br />
I’ll erase a debt.<br />
Two.<br />
Let’s bury the hatchet about Noah.<br />
You ask too much for a lowly S class.<br />
Hyunjae Sung’s face creased into a sad face, and I did not care, two debts had to be paid.<br />
He seemed to know his crimes as he accepted the deal soon enough.<br />
The car, fortunately, turned to the raising area.<br />
Noah was waiting anxiously at the parking lot.<br />
com for the best novel reading experience.<br />
Mr.<br />
Yoojin!Noah rushed towards me and held my arm.<br />
He then glared at Hyunjae Sung.  </p>
<p>Why does he look worse than before.<br />
He did too much as he always does.<br />
Let him rest.<br />
Did he know whose fault it was? Hyunjae Sung looked at my chest before getting back in the car.  </p>
<p>I’m curious avout what you are going to say to your little brother.<br />
Hey, what? Are you going to tell him?!The bastard disappeared into the car without a reply.<br />
What excuse should I make? I was thinking of getting fake skin to hide the wound as I still had a few days before Yoohyun came out.<br />
com for the best novel reading experience.<br />
Are you alright?My little brother appeared as soon as I washed up after arriving at home.<br />
Irin had become tangible from the tattoo and sat perched on my shoulder to look alternatively at Yoohyun and me.<br />
Well, little brother, you seemed to have used a gate stone.  </p>

<p>&lt; Dokkaebi[1 (1) .<br />
After washing up and changing clothes and eating breakfast and lunch combined, somehow my head became cool.<br />
Though my heart felt like it was beating faster than normal.<br />
I thought my hangover had disappeared but maybe it didn’t? How should I say it, it felt like my Mental stat was reduced.<br />
‘Though I guess it would be like that after realizing an unexpected skill effect from yesterday’s events.<br />
’ But it was still a little weird.<br />
First, let’s sort it out.<br />
1.<br />
I couldn’t ever tell anyone at all about the keyword’s effect.<br />
There weren’t many in the world I could hang my life on and trust.<br />
It’d be one thing if I were able to read minds, but how would you completely know someone else’s intentions? If they didn’t have a history of risking their life to save me, like Yoohyun, then I couldn’t ever immediately trust them.<br />
My stats were F-Rank.<br />
com I had to always remember that and be careful.<br />
I was a weakling who would go to heaven[2 if a passing S-Rank hit me, if I put myself forward just because I had an L-Rank skill.<br />
2.<br />
When I used the keyword, I had to be cautious to the utmost.<br />
Right now, there were only four people, but from now on, if I kept on using the same keyword, anyone could notice something.<br />
More than anything, using it somewhere where there were a lot of people, like yesterday, was definitely forbidden.<br />
If it was that simply the growth skill application would be impossible if the keyword was discovered, then I would be able to afford it, but if the mental brainwashing came to light, then there would obviously be a huge fuss.<br />
So, if I had to use the keyword, I had to mix in several other words 1:1 in order to be safe.<br />
3.<br />
Prioritizing monsters over people, I had to find S-Rank level magic beasts to protect me as soon as possible.<br />
Even after 5 years, there weren’t any instances of monsters who could communicate with humans.<br />
So, I didn’t have to worry about the skill effect disappearing for Peace and the monster that I would receive later.<br />
If I kept two S-Rank monsters near me, I would be able to relax about my personal matters.<br />
4.<br />
Finally, let’s not take the damn system lightly.<br />
I didn’t know if there might be another trap hidden, so let’s be careful, very careful.<br />
com ‘If I were stat S-Rank, I wouldn’t have needed to worry this much.<br />
’ It was definitely too much.<br />
Ah, I was about to feel mentally weak again.<br />
Why was I like this today of all days? It was a feeling like I had taken off and thrown the armor that I was wearing.<br />
…Was it because I overloaded my liver? ‘Let’s go get training at least.<br />
’ It would probably get better after I rest for a day or two.<br />
As expected, excessive drinking was bad for the body.  </p>
<p>Ahjussi!When I went outside, Yerim, who had already gone out and was waiting, happily greeted me.<br />
Maybe she had gotten expert styling, because today’s clothes were refreshing and cute.  </p>
<p>I heard you were really drunk, are you okay.<br />
Yeah, I’m fine.<br />
That’s a relief.<br />
Please don’t drink a lot.<br />
It’s not good for your body.<br />
Even so, I was feeling something bad in real time.<br />
See, my heart was pounding again.<br />
I should ask while Yoo Myeongwoo hadn’t come out yet.  </p>
<p>Yerim, say…I was wondering what to do, but there weren’t people listening so I asked directly.  </p>
<p>Is there anyone you think of when you look at me.<br />
S-someone I think of?Flustered, Yerim’s eyes darted around.<br />
Bingo.<br />
There was.  </p>
<p>It’s okay.<br />
Say it.<br />
It was okay as long as you didn’t say mom.  </p>
<p>When I was young… when I was living in a house, there was an ahjussi next door who looked after me.<br />
Ahjussi! Hooray! Yerim’s next door ahjussi whose name I didn’t know, thank you.  </p>
<p>He was younger than ahjussi, but back then I was also younger.<br />
Mom said he was a next-door student, but I saw him as a fully grown adult, so I just called him an ahjussi.<br />
It wasn’t that he resembled ahjussi, he was sickly.<br />
Enough to make my young self worry.<br />
Yerim’s gaze was towards me, but it seemed to be looking at the past.<br />
She continued speaking, thinking of an old memory.  </p>
<p>Our house was on the nicer side, but the next-door house was even bigger and nicer.<br />
The yard was pretty too.<br />
There was a white swing, and a large dog.<br />
Ahjussi’s body was weak so he didn’t go out of his house much.<br />
Instead he played with me almost everyday.<br />
You must have liked him a lot.<br />
Yerim nodded her head hard.<br />
Yes.<br />
I really liked him a lot.<br />
Back then, I spent more time with ahjussi instead of mom or dad.<br />
My dad was busy and my mom went to do church volunteer work with the lady[3 next door since I got along well with ahjussi.<br />
So was that why that ahjussi… student became the most influential caregiver? It might have been different if Yerim’s parents had continued to live, but they passed away early.  </p>
<p>And I thought that once I grew up later, I would be stronger than ahjussi, so I would protect him…She trailed off.<br />
I didn’t have to hear the following words to guess.<br />
After holding back either tears or a sigh, Yerim looked up at me with an uneasy glint in her eyes.  </p>
<p>It definitely makes you feel bad right? When I look at ahjussi, I think of someone else… Usually, people don’t like that.<br />
No, it’s okay.<br />
It’s not like it’s a criminal; you said it’s someone you like.<br />
Rather, it feels good because you think that way about me?Of course, there were a lot of people who would feel bad, but in my case, but I brought it onto myself.<br />
Even though he was sickly, he was a nice wealthy male student, so it was enough to be thankful.<br />
At my words, Yerim was relieved and smiled widely.<br />
Really? As expected, ahjussi is also a good person.<br />
I thought you would be good natured since the first time I saw you!…Even though you yelled about statuatory rape.  </p>
<p>Do you by any chance remember when you first thought of that ahjussi when you saw me.<br />
Yes.<br />
At the steakhouse, after you talked gibberish.<br />
That easygoing-looking appearance seemed familiar.<br />
If it was after I talked gibberish, it was right after I said the ‘I love you’ keyword.<br />
As expected, it definitely was the effect due to the keyword influence.  </p>
<p>I will definitely protect ahjussi.<br />
Okay, thanks.<br />
Yerim clung on like normal, but one side of my heart became cold unlike normal.<br />
Thinking that it was all due to the skill, I was a little afraid.<br />
com …At any rate, if I was careful, there wouldn’t be any problem, so why was I worrying in advance? Was it really because of my liver? Because I was screwed up all last night? Or was there a different reason-.<br />
Suddenly.<br />
Did you wait long?Yoo Myeongwoo opened the door and came out.  </p>
<p>No, not really.<br />
Let’s go.<br />
We’ll be late.<br />
Since today was theory class, I should listen a reasonable amount and come back early and rest.<br />
The novice Hunter theory classroom was smaller than I had expected.<br />
Unlike the Association facilities that could admit several hundreds of people, there were exactly only five desks and chairs.<br />
Then again, it would be surprising if Haeyeon, which was picky about screening rank ability, took in more than five novices at once.<br />
Even now, the only real newcomer was just Yerim.<br />
‘The chair’s comfortable.<br />
’ It must have been expensive.<br />
com A short while after we each sat at our seats, the person in charge of the theory class appeared.<br />
The person who opened the door and came in was a woman in her early twenties wearing light sandals and a long tropical one-piece dress.<br />
There was an air of being immediately about to go off to summer vacation, so was she really the person in charge of class? And it felt like I had seen that face wearing round glasses before, too.  </p>
<p>Hello.<br />
The woman standing in front of the lecture podium put down the materials she brought and spoke.  </p>
<p>I am Suk Hayan.<br />
I am the person in charge of your theory class today.<br />
Suk Hayan! When I heard her name, I remembered.<br />
The expert on dungeon studies, Doctor White[4.<br />
She was a young genius who had originally studied dungeons and Awakened People with her statistics major before going to the U.<br />
S.<br />
and playing a large role in discovering the laws governing dungeon formation.<br />
She looked younger than the appearance I had seen on TV, so I didn’t recognize her right away.<br />
I remembered her being older than me, but with her make-up and clothes different, she had a total baby face.<br />
Why was that kind of impressive person here? It was the time when she was still in Korea, but she wasn’t at a level where she would train novices.<br />
First, I will talk[5 about the basic knowledge of dungeons.<br />
Suk Hayan placed printouts on each desk.<br />
Then, she stopped and stood in front of my desk.<br />
Behind the round glasses lenses, the two also round eyes looked straight down at me.<br />
What was it?.<br />
…Do you have something to tell me.<br />
You are Han Yoojin-ssi, correct?She said, as if she was waiting.  </p>
<p>Yes.<br />
That is correct.<br />
I heard a lot about you from Uncle, I mean Haeyon’s head of human resources.<br />
…Head of human resources? Uncle? Now that I thought of it, their surnames were the same.<br />
com He wasn’t that kind of person.  </p>
<p>I don’t know what you have heard, but Department Head Suk overestimates me a little.<br />
It seems like you are being modest.<br />
He isn’t someone who would overestimate.<br />
He’s very particular.<br />
Suk Hayan said, beaming.<br />
Well, that ahjussi was indeed particular.<br />
Still, I was right that he was exaggeratedly mistaken about me.  </p>
<p>I wasn’t being modest.<br />
Before that, could you tell me what he said about me.<br />
I heard that you were knowledgeable about Awakened People and dungeons, enough to make him completely surprised.<br />
So he really didn’t say things about being able to know dungeons types ahead of time.<br />
It was a relief I didn’t assess him incorrectly.<br />
I regained my composure and replied with a smile.  </p>
<p>As expected, it really is an excessive compliment? If you happened to deliberately come find me because of what you heard from Department Head Suk, I feel apologetic.<br />
I came to Haeyeon to meet the Dokkaebi.<br />
Of course, undertaking the training was because of Han Yoojin-ssi.<br />
com for the best novel reading experience.<br />
You wouldn’t be speaking of real dokkaebi, so are you speaking of a Hunter.<br />
Yes.<br />
A Hunter famous for special skills.<br />
If it was the Dokkaebi, then I also knew a lot about them.<br />
No, I couldn’t say that I knew a lot.<br />
Like the nickname, they wore a dokkaebi mask and clothes that seemed like they were from a traditional madangguk[6, and this special Hunter didn’t reveal their age and gender, much less their name, even 5 years later.<br />
The reason why he, or possibly she[7, who wasn’t registered at the Association at all, was famous was exactly because of those special skills.<br />
Mid-range teleportation and hiding.<br />
Unlike instant movement[8 that couldn’t pass over blocked places, teleportation let you move in and out of anywhere.<br />
And since hiding was added, they really were something elusive that suited a dokkaebi.<br />
‘Their way of living was good too.<br />
’ Being able to secretly go inside anywhere was an incredibly threatening ability.<br />
If you rashly showed it, you could become everyone’s target of attack at any time.<br />
com But the Dokkaebi boldly revealed their ability to the world.<br />
‘I have all sorts of secrets bundled away, but because I’m safe, I will never release them.<br />
’ With that kind of announcement.<br />
In the first place, they were a Hunter who was extremely hard to catch because of their skill’s characteristics.<br />
But now, far from attacking, it had become a situation where they had to be protected.<br />
Since there was no person in the world, especially organizations, that didn’t conceal secrets.<br />
Thanks to that, the Dokkaebi wasn’t affiliated with anywhere and acted freely.<br />
They rarely attacked dungeons, and instead, they played the role of a messenger who delivered important objects and letters and such.<br />
Since they could figure out any secret, they were somebody who could relax more than anybody else.<br />
‘And after a few years, it was brought to light that they could make ultra-long-distance movement portals.<br />
’ There was an uproar saying that they should be a dokkaebi king or god instead of just a dokkaebi.<br />
Since it was a rather useful ability, they became extremely sought after[9, but the Dokkaebi didn’t use it except for rescue use.<br />
Of course during dungeon breaks, but they also saved many people in various natural disasters, so that their fame and approval ratings were through the roof[10.<br />
com Even though their personality was a little weird, they were a kind person and an impressive one.  </p>
<p>I didn’t know they were at Haeyeon.<br />
I would like to meet them once too.<br />
There is no reason that can’t be possible.<br />
If you converse with me about this and that until the meeting time.<br />
Aren’t you holding a class, instructor[11.<br />
You speak exactly like a professor.<br />
Suk Hayan rolled her eyes slightly and went up onto the podium.<br />
Her continuing lecture content was considerably excellent.<br />
She had an incredible understanding about dungeons and about Awakened People, and her explanations were easy and nice to hear, as if they were slipping into our ears[12.<br />
And she was skilled at using audiovisual materials.<br />
It was to the extent that I would unconsciously focus even on things I already knew.<br />
Still, there were a few points that she got wrong.<br />
No matter now hard she studied, the materials were the amount from 3 years, so it could only be worse than the amount from 8 years.  </p>
<p>With this, the novice Hunter theory class is concluded.<br />
Our professor, thank you for listening to this lacking content.<br />
com …Why professor again.<br />
To someone who hadn’t even stepped over the threshold of a college.  </p>
<p>It wasn’t lacking at all.<br />
The lecture was incredibly masterful.<br />
It was easy to listen to, and also easy to understand.<br />
Since she called me a professor, I gave my assessment.<br />
Then Suk Hayan rolled her eyes again.  </p>
<p>I am thankful for your praise, but at times you had an expression like you were saying that it was wrong.<br />
Your gaze was somehow exactly like my major professor, so that it felt like I had gone back to my undergraduate days.<br />
Was I like that?.<br />
The very first time was when I was explaining about Awakening.<br />
Awakening usually occurs when you feel personally threatened, and initial skills are effects that are for protecting oneself.<br />
That part.<br />
She was sharp-witted and had a good memory.<br />
Then again, she had the title of ‘genius’.<br />
I sheepishly smiled.  </p>
<p>It wasn’t completely wrong.<br />
It was mostly correct.<br />
Usually?Suk Hayan widened her eyes.<br />
It was an expression that was urging for the following words.<br />
Was it okay to easily disclose it like this? Though it wasn’t particularly important information.  </p>
<p>I see it as divided between aptitude and environment.<br />
Rather than being for protecting oneself, there are many skills that can’t be immediately used for combat.<br />
However, aren’t most of them combat and combat assistance.<br />
It is most of them, not all of them.<br />
And, the environment was so that most would be like that.<br />
If you check, the proportion of Awakened People with skills unrelated to combat would have increased recently.<br />
Of course, ‘huk, stand up, me, you might die!’ situations were the easiest to Awaken in, so combat skills would still take up the majority.<br />
But now, when dungeons rarely burst open, the proportion of people Awakening in everyday life could only increase.<br />
A while ago, even the Hunter Association had someone who had a seafishing skill and an earthworm-calling skill.<br />
Suk Hayan closed her mouth for a short while and wrinkled her forehead, before nodding her head.<br />
Advertisements.<br />
Okay, I will check.<br />
com for a better experience.<br />
Wait please.<br />
Are you perhaps going to check them one by one.<br />
I don’t have time, but I can make some, and Han Yoojin-ssi has a lot of time left over.<br />
It’s not time left for Suk Hayan-ssi to use.<br />
Suk Hayan put on an expression wondering what she should do.  </p>
<p>…Is there something you want? Should I pay something like research funds.<br />
I just want to rest, though.<br />
I will get you a 5-star hotel room.<br />
A suite with a good view.<br />
Why was a hotel coming up? My room also had a good view.<br />
com Solidifying closeness wouldn’t be a bad thing.<br />
Though she would be going to the U.<br />
S.<br />
later… Wait, if I happened to give her a hint, would she be able to figure out the laws of dungeon formation in Korea? Hm… the number of dungeons was too lacking for that.<br />
The number of dungeons was proportional to the population and the area of territory.<br />
So, in order to continue researching the laws of dungeon formation, which required a lot of data, Suk Hayan had no choice but to go abroad.<br />
Since there were no places that would allow a foreigner to investigate their dungeons.<br />
The royalties were no joke, so it was a waste.<br />
Was there no way to get her to research here?.<br />
Since I want to meet the Dokkaebi, please let me meet with them for at least a short while.<br />
I can’t answer everything.<br />
Really? Thank you!Suk Hayan delightedly clapped her hands.<br />
Was she that pleased? [1 dokkaebi are mythical creatures from krn folklore, and the closest eng equiv would be goblins I guess.<br />

‘die’.<br />

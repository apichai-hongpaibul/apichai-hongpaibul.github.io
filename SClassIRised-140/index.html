<p>Chapter 136 Part 1 Out of the Frying Pan into the Fire 
Yes, it’s the Dungeon Break area.
Your guild leader’s car wrecked so we need a new one.
They are asking what type of vehicle they should send.
Do you have any preferences?
You really have all the brands in your garage?
If they are in the market, yes.
He’s in his own league.
I should ask him to bring a farm cultivator.
Maybe I will, because it will be a sight.
But I asked for anything moderately comfortable since a cultivator would not make a pleasant ride.
I returned the phone to Hyunjae Sung after I ended the call.
My phone died.
While the grace had protected me from direct damage made by Hyunjae Sung’s rampage, indirect damage seemed to be something else.
I needed to find an electricity resistance item since he was the nemesis of all electronic items.</p>
<p>What was the magnetic thing? Do you do all things that have to do with electricity? Can you charge your phone by yourself?
It’s easier to plug in the phone rather than using the skill while considering voltage and current.
Controlling it is more difficult than you think.
So it was not impossible, and I was curious how precise his control was.
I pondered over what other things were applicable but stopped because I was too tired.
I wanted to go to sleep as my body became as limp as wet cotton.
Thud! I heard something heavy fall.
I opened my half-closed eyes and turned my head to where the noise had come from.
com -Mr.
Yoojin! It was Noah.
A golden dragon landed on top of a giant monster I estimated to be an A class Dungeon Boss.
Hyunjae Sung would not need to go to the junkyard since the spot was where the sportscar had been parked.
-Are you hurt anywhere? Noah looked at me being carried by Hyunjae Sung with a worried expression.
While his eyes were soft, his half-open wings and sharp nails were tense as if he would fly at Hyunjae Sung.
However, since the keyword has been applied, Noah’s presence was weaker than Hyunjae Sung or Taewon Song.</p>
<p>I’m all right, just tired.
-You have a chest wound.
I should have changed my clothes.
Although Noah applied his B class healing skills, the chest wound did not heal.
Noah looked surprised, and Hyunjae Sung seemed intrigued when only the scratches I earned rolling about the floor healed.
-My skills seem to not be effective because they are of low level… 
No.
You can specialize in healing.
People are treated with respect with just B class single heal skills.
It’s just that the wound is a special one.
How strange is it?I got goosebumps from him murmuring something to himself.
Please return the fear resistance level to what it was.
-The gate has been settled with this last monster.
We should return.
Noah spoke with his front legs stretched.
I wanted to go home as soon as possible.
– Thank you for your work.
But since we already called a car, we should ride it.
I did not want to ride Noah in this state since it was scary without any safety devices.
Noah would not drop me easily, and I had my grace, but scary things would remain scary.</p>
<p>Please heal Mr.
Taewon Song if it’s alright with you.
He’s hurt pretty badly.
-Are the injuries serious? Noah inclined his head as if the news was a surprise.
He said that Taewon Song had been against an S class monster but he seemed to be more than a match for it.
I just laughed.
The monster was easy, but there was a person worse than an S class monster.
Please help.
-I can’t leave Mr.
Yoojin behind like this… His pale gray eyes narrowed and glanced at Hyunjae Sung.
I understood that the situation was an uneasy one, but there was no other choice.</p>
<p>Guild leader Sung came because I called him.
Don’t worry.
-All right.
Please return safely.
I saw the golden dragon hesitate and then fly to the night sky with outstretched wings.
While he would have potions, Taewon Song would not have used them so easily.
Since the situation has been somewhat cleaned up, he would have done first aid with a low level potion.
My little brother and Hyunjae Sung…He would need at least a high level potion to heal the wounds made by those violent attack skills.
He would ask a healer to ration potions.</p>
<p>I don’t know why you would have a wound like this.
Hyunjae Sung had been staring at my chest wound for a while now.
com for a better experience 
My hand slid when I was chopping scallions in the kitchen.
You seem to cook with an item that will make a wound unhealable with a B class healing skill.
The scallion was S class.
Can I slice it open?He was not talking about scallions, and I had goosebumps on my arm.</p>
<p>Are you crazy? You’ll kill me.
I have good control, so don’t worry.
Just let me leave.
I’ll call a cab.
Cabs would never come up here, and my phone was dead.
I had to look for a phonebooth.
Hyunjae Sung let me out without any complaints.
My legs were weak, but I could somehow stand.
com I walked forward, looking for an open convenience store when Hyunjae Sung made me face him with a hand on my shoulder.
I was looking at him with my neck raised from the usual distance, but he seemed to be farther away.
I felt a pang of envy at his height.</p>
<p>You’re not nice today.
I think not cursing you for asking me to let you slice my chest open was more than enough kindness.
Didn’t you curse?
That was just me facing reality.
Then, kind Yoojin.
He had a scary smile.
I did not run because it would have been a useless attempt.
It might have been better for me to choose a risky flight, but Hyunjae Sung would not have sent me along.
Noah would have ranked below Taewon Song on today’s sacrificial lamb list, and my name would be right below.</p>
<p>Is it because of leader Song that you’re not your usual self?
I’m not feeling well lately.
We have been busy.
com Hyunjae Sung did not seem to know about Taewon Song’s pillage skills.
He probably knew it as a nullifying skill during battle.</p>
<p>That’s unfortunate.
I should have paid more attention.
You’re a busy person, and I would appreciate it if you did not give me your attention from now on.
Between us? No.</p>

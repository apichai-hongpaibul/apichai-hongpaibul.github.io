<p>Chapter 136 Part 1 Out of the Frying Pan into the Fire.<br />
Yes, it’s the Dungeon Break area.<br />
Your guild leader’s car wrecked so we need a new one.<br />
They are asking what type of vehicle they should send.<br />
Do you have any preferences.<br />
You really have all the brands in your garage.<br />
If they are in the market, yes.<br />
He’s in his own league.<br />
I should ask him to bring a farm cultivator.<br />
Maybe I will, because it will be a sight.<br />
But I asked for anything moderately comfortable since a cultivator would not make a pleasant ride.<br />
I returned the phone to Hyunjae Sung after I ended the call.<br />
My phone died.<br />
While the grace had protected me from direct damage made by Hyunjae Sung’s rampage, indirect damage seemed to be something else.<br />
I needed to find an electricity resistance item since he was the nemesis of all electronic items.  </p>
<p>What was the magnetic thing? Do you do all things that have to do with electricity? Can you charge your phone by yourself.<br />
It’s easier to plug in the phone rather than using the skill while considering voltage and current.<br />
Controlling it is more difficult than you think.<br />
So it was not impossible, and I was curious how precise his control was.<br />
I pondered over what other things were applicable but stopped because I was too tired.<br />
I wanted to go to sleep as my body became as limp as wet cotton.<br />
Thud! I heard something heavy fall.<br />
I opened my half-closed eyes and turned my head to where the noise had come from.<br />
com -Mr.<br />
Yoojin! It was Noah.<br />
A golden dragon landed on top of a giant monster I estimated to be an A class Dungeon Boss.<br />
Hyunjae Sung would not need to go to the junkyard since the spot was where the sportscar had been parked.<br />
-Are you hurt anywhere? Noah looked at me being carried by Hyunjae Sung with a worried expression.<br />
While his eyes were soft, his half-open wings and sharp nails were tense as if he would fly at Hyunjae Sung.<br />
However, since the keyword has been applied, Noah’s presence was weaker than Hyunjae Sung or Taewon Song.  </p>
<p>I’m all right, just tired.<br />
-You have a chest wound.<br />
I should have changed my clothes.<br />
Although Noah applied his B class healing skills, the chest wound did not heal.<br />
Noah looked surprised, and Hyunjae Sung seemed intrigued when only the scratches I earned rolling about the floor healed.<br />
-My skills seem to not be effective because they are of low level….<br />
No.<br />
You can specialize in healing.<br />
People are treated with respect with just B class single heal skills.<br />
It’s just that the wound is a special one.<br />
How strange is it?I got goosebumps from him murmuring something to himself.<br />
Please return the fear resistance level to what it was.<br />
-The gate has been settled with this last monster.<br />
We should return.<br />
Noah spoke with his front legs stretched.<br />
I wanted to go home as soon as possible.<br />
– Thank you for your work.<br />
But since we already called a car, we should ride it.<br />
I did not want to ride Noah in this state since it was scary without any safety devices.<br />
Noah would not drop me easily, and I had my grace, but scary things would remain scary.  </p>
<p>Please heal Mr.<br />
Taewon Song if it’s alright with you.<br />
He’s hurt pretty badly.<br />
-Are the injuries serious? Noah inclined his head as if the news was a surprise.<br />
He said that Taewon Song had been against an S class monster but he seemed to be more than a match for it.<br />
I just laughed.<br />
The monster was easy, but there was a person worse than an S class monster.<br />
Please help.<br />
-I can’t leave Mr.<br />
Yoojin behind like this… His pale gray eyes narrowed and glanced at Hyunjae Sung.<br />
I understood that the situation was an uneasy one, but there was no other choice.  </p>
<p>Guild leader Sung came because I called him.<br />
Don’t worry.<br />
-All right.<br />
Please return safely.<br />
I saw the golden dragon hesitate and then fly to the night sky with outstretched wings.<br />
While he would have potions, Taewon Song would not have used them so easily.<br />
Since the situation has been somewhat cleaned up, he would have done first aid with a low level potion.<br />
My little brother and Hyunjae Sung…He would need at least a high level potion to heal the wounds made by those violent attack skills.<br />
He would ask a healer to ration potions.  </p>
<p>I don’t know why you would have a wound like this.<br />
Hyunjae Sung had been staring at my chest wound for a while now.<br />
com for a better experience.<br />
My hand slid when I was chopping scallions in the kitchen.<br />
You seem to cook with an item that will make a wound unhealable with a B class healing skill.<br />
The scallion was S class.<br />
Can I slice it open?He was not talking about scallions, and I had goosebumps on my arm.  </p>
<p>Are you crazy? You’ll kill me.<br />
I have good control, so don’t worry.<br />
Just let me leave.<br />
I’ll call a cab.<br />
Cabs would never come up here, and my phone was dead.<br />
I had to look for a phonebooth.<br />
Hyunjae Sung let me out without any complaints.<br />
My legs were weak, but I could somehow stand.<br />
com I walked forward, looking for an open convenience store when Hyunjae Sung made me face him with a hand on my shoulder.<br />
I was looking at him with my neck raised from the usual distance, but he seemed to be farther away.<br />
I felt a pang of envy at his height.  </p>
<p>You’re not nice today.<br />
I think not cursing you for asking me to let you slice my chest open was more than enough kindness.<br />
Didn’t you curse.<br />
That was just me facing reality.<br />
Then, kind Yoojin.<br />
He had a scary smile.<br />
I did not run because it would have been a useless attempt.<br />
It might have been better for me to choose a risky flight, but Hyunjae Sung would not have sent me along.<br />
Noah would have ranked below Taewon Song on today’s sacrificial lamb list, and my name would be right below.  </p>
<p>Is it because of leader Song that you’re not your usual self.<br />
I’m not feeling well lately.<br />
We have been busy.<br />
com Hyunjae Sung did not seem to know about Taewon Song’s pillage skills.<br />
He probably knew it as a nullifying skill during battle.  </p>
<p>That’s unfortunate.<br />
I should have paid more attention.<br />
You’re a busy person, and I would appreciate it if you did not give me your attention from now on.<br />
Between us? No.  </p>

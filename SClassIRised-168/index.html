    <h1 id="the-s-classes-that-i-raised-16">The S-Classes That I Raised 16.</h1>
<p>Chapter 149: Dragon Siblings (2) High-class hunters were often attractive, and S class hunters were like celebrities.<br />
They also earned a lot of money, had superhuman strength, and protected the world from the threat of dungeon breaks.<br />
People like that were, of course, popular, and the government managed their images so citizens would be less anxious.<br />
Thus, I had heard that they had a lot of fans even before I regressed.<br />
‘Did Soyoung Kang make it herself?’ Noah had not been revealed much to the public, nor had he officially become a Korean hunter.<br />
However, the people had paid attention to him due to his ability to transform into a dragon.<br />
‘Yoohyun also probably had a fan club.<br />
’ I was curious.<br />
I had seen on television before my return that the most popular hunter in Korea was Hyunjae Sung, no matter how much I wanted to refute it.<br />
He was world-class, since being at the top of the rankings was attractive in itself.<br />
Most people admired the number one spot and remembered who had stood there.<br />
Hmm, he did irritate me.<br />
Yoohyun dragged the last hunter affected by the poison in front of me while burning the toxic gas in the air.<br />
I appreciated his help, but there was one thing.  </p>
<p>Don’t you have to go to Mr.<br />
Noah.<br />
He said she’s his sister.<br />
He’ll manage.<br />
Hey, worry about him a bit.<br />
Turn your head over there since I can’t see.<br />
There’s nothing you have to see.<br />
I could tell a lie when I saw one.<br />
I reached out to hold my brother’s face and force him to turn around.<br />
His gaze moved, and I could see the three facing off one another.<br />
Riette was standing like the devil, while Soyoung Kang did not falter a bit.<br />
Noah stood like a pillar of light out of the three, and the light was bright today.  </p>
<p>Sweetie, are you an S class.<br />
I’m an A.<br />
You’re feisty.<br />
I don’t feel pressure from dragon types because of my skill.<br />
You seem to be close to a dragon, Ms.<br />
Riette.<br />
So that was why she could approach Noah so easily.<br />
I had thought she had a fear nullifying skill or an affinity skill for dragons.<br />
Riette’s eyes creased at Soyoung Kang’s response, and she seemed to become even more curious.  </p>
<p>Not being scared of me does not mean that there’s no danger.<br />
You should be more careful.<br />
That’s true.<br />
com Yoohyun spoke the latter sentence, which was something I knew.  </p>
<p>Ms.<br />
Kang, please step aside.<br />
I heard Noah’s voice and wished Yoohyun would turn his head because I could not see clearly.  </p>
<p>While I appreciate your help, it’s dangerous.<br />
Don’t worry.<br />
Soyoung Kang shouted confidently.  </p>
<p>I only need to ride you, Mr.<br />
Noah.<br />
…Yes?’.<br />
I can use both of our stats when I ride a dragon, and if we fit well together, we can use up to one hundred percent.<br />
Then, our stats will be that of an average S class, at least.<br />
com Soyoung Kang stared at Noah with bright eyes.<br />
If the dragon rider skill’s effect were stat addition, they together would be able to surpass Riette since Noah was an S class.<br />
Since Comet’s stats can grow to an S class, they would battle like an S class hunter.  </p>
<p>So, let me ride you!Soyoung Kang spoke in excitement and anticipation.<br />
Had she come to ride instead of helping Noah? They would be able to fight Riette if she used the dragon rider skill.  </p>
<p>Sweetie, you can use your skill on me as well, right?Riette spoke before Noah could respond, and Soyoung Kang turned around to face Riette while Noah tensed.  </p>
<p>Since you’re a dragon type, probably.<br />
Do you want to ride me.<br />
Yes?Riette had approached Soyoung Kang and gently smiled, looking down on her.<br />
Her hand dotted with black scales swayed elegantly in front of Soyoung Kang.<br />
How about it? Don’t you want to see how I would look as a dragon.<br />
Y, your scales are black.<br />
I thought as much.<br />
Soyoung Kang gulped as she followed Riette’s half-dragon hand with her eyes.<br />
They spelled trouble.  </p>
<p>Hey, don’t we have to get Ms.<br />
Kang out? Why are you only watching.<br />
She’s not going to be attacked, so why bother?Yoohyun spoke coldly.  </p>
<p>Aren’t you guys close.<br />
No.<br />
We haven’t met much.<br />
My younger brother answered like I was saying nonsense.<br />
It would have been nice to earn some points since you might become closer in the future.<br />
…Are you similar to Mr.<br />
Noah’s form?Soyoung Kang had been agonizing over her choice while looking back and forth between Noah and Riette, and the elder sibling laughed silently at Soyoung’s question.  </p>
<p>We’re very different.<br />
How, how do you look.<br />
It’s better to show you.<br />
Riette stepped way back with a light step.<br />
Hey, wait.  </p>
<p>Not here.<br />
Don’t worry, darling.<br />
I’ll be smaller than usual!Smaller was not a dependable word, and Riette’s tall figure started to change.<br />
A black shape inflated instantly, and I could see a head, a tail, and four legs.<br />
Formidable thorns soared as red-black scales covered her body.<br />
com She was certainly smaller, but Riette was still a&amp;)qs large as a big truck despite shrinking more than in half.<br />
The black dragon, who looked like the definition for ferocity, raised her head.<br />
Her tail flicked lightly, and a part of the dungeon building crumbled under it.<br />
If Riette had been her usual size, the entire building would have been damaged, and the Hunter Association would have another heavy burden on top of everything they were going through.<br />
One could say that Riette was already an added burden.  </p>

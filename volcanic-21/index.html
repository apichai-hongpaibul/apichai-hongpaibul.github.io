=========================
Editor: Imagine
Gu Pung went to the place where Zhuge Sega was gathered at as it wasnt that hard to find them.
 The territory of Guizhou wasnt that wide and it was hard to approach them if they werent a force of the same rank.</p>
<p>In the case of other visitors, and especially martial artists, they couldnt get closer because of the wall they had set up and could only watch from far away.</p>
<p>The Fourteenth Gallant Sword!
A middle aged man that had the beard like a goats and was dressed like a scholar raised his hand from far away and greeted Gu Pung.</p>
<p>Oh, isnt it the Goatie Minister Zhuge Zak? Its been a really long while.</p>
<p>Gu Pung and Zhuge Zak knew each other.</p>
<p>It has been three years.</p>
<p>Zhuge Zak glanced behind Gu Pung.</p>
<p>By the way, it looks like the young ones behind you belong to the Lotus Peak.
 Is their protector perhaps the Fourteenth Gallant Sword?
You saw it correctly.</p>
<p>Haha, what a coincidence.
 Im also in the same situation as you.</p>
<p>Zhuge Sak glanced at the people that were on hold behind him.
 The age and the gender of the group was varied but they had a similarity of having a thin body.</p>
<p>Zhuge Sega has also brought the children that will become the next brilliant generation of the Righteous Faction.
 I think that this is also fate so if its fine with you I would like to create a place of harmony to interact with each other.
 They are all my nieces and nephews.</p>
<p>Nice to meet you great master.
 Its an honor being able to meet the Fourteenth Gallant Sword I have only heard through rumors.</p>
<p>Zhuge Zak had three nieces.</p>
<p>The youth that stood at the front was eye catching and he had white skin, a sharp jaw and outstanding beauty.</p>
<p>If it wasnt for his voice, that had changed through puberty, or his clothes one would mistake him for a woman because of his beauty.</p>
<p>Behind him were a boy and a girl that werent adults yet, just like Ju Seo Cheon.</p>
<p>The boy had his shoulders drooping and his face couldnt be easily seen due to that he emanated a gloomy atmosphere.</p>
<p>In the case of the girl, she was bright and proud compared to the boy.
 Her beauty was also considerable, although it wasnt comparable to Nak Seo Wol.</p>
<p>Oh, are you perhaps…
Gu Pungs eyes turned wide and looked at the youth.
 It seemed like he realized who this youth was.</p>
<p>I am called Zhuge Sang.
 In Kang Ho I am called by the embarrassing nickname of Beautiful Jade Confucian.</p>
<p>The youth blushed and smiled bitterly.</p>
<p>I was wondering why you were so familiar! So you were a young master of the Zhuge family!
Gu Pung placed a fist on his palm and mumbled as if he was correct.
 The Beautiful Jade Confucian, Zhuge Sang.
 His beauty was known to the world early on even though he was a boy.</p>
<p>But besides that, he also had a reputation for being the one that would lead the Zhuge family.</p>
<p>I am Zhuge Suran.
 Brother Sang is my step brother.</p>
<p>The introduction of Zhuge Suran was a bit insensitive so Gu Pung flinched at that moment but then passed it as if it was nothing.</p>
<p>These kinds of things were common in a great family like the Zhuge Clan.</p>
<p>Ah, Zhuge Suran!
Jang Hong got surprised at the name Zhuge Suran and let out an exclamation.
 Everyone nearby turned to look at him.</p>
<p>Oh my, im sorry.</p>
<p>Jang Hong scratched his head and apologized as he thought that the introduction got cut off because of him.</p>
<p>Theres no need to feel sorry.
 On the contrary, Im happy that a member of the Lotus Peak knows Suran.</p>
<p>Zhuge Sak smiled proudly.</p>
<p>How would I not know about her? Of course I know her.</p>
<p>Jang Hong glanced at Zhuge Suran and flushed.</p>
<p>The existence of Zhuge Suran itself was enough to lit up a fire on the heart of a boy that only trained all his life.</p>
<p>In addition, all males tend to be attracted to the opposite sex, whether they are kids, adults or the elderly.
 This was an unchangeable law.</p>
<p>Zhuge Suran was the daughter of another woman but she was still a daughter of the family, so it was unavoidable that her fame would spread.</p>
<p>Most of all, she looked dignified since she was young but also became popular because of the intellect she possessed.
 As expected of someone from the Zhuge Sega.</p>
<p>Because of these reasons, no one could see her lightly even though she was the daughter of another woman.</p>
<p>Thats an excessive compliment but im still grateful that you speak that way about me.</p>
<p>Zhuge Suran didnt smile but still replied back with softer eyes than before.</p>
<p>Jang Hongs face turned even redder, like a ripe persimmon.</p>
<p>And…
I, Im called….
Zhuge…Seung-Kye…
A little boy the same age as Zhuge Suran.
 Zhuge Seung Kye introduced himself with a crawling voice.</p>
<p>A voice with no strength, drooping shoulders and no confidence.
 That was the opposite of Zhuge Suran.</p>
<p>Um, Im lacking knowledge so I dont know much about this young noble.
 Im sorry.</p>
<p>Gu Pung tilted his head slightly.</p>
<p>Its obvious as Seung Kye doesnt show himself even in the Zhuge Sega.
 Hes a lacking child so I hope you understand.
 He is a good child.</p>
<p>Zhuge Sang stood next to Zhuge Seung Kye and patted his shoulder.</p>
<p>It was a really nice smile.</p>
<p>Haha, it seems like he will get along well with you, brother.</p>
<p>Jang Hong hit Ju Seo Cheons shoulders and mumbled.
 He was claiming boldly that he was looking down on Zhuge Seung Kye.</p>
<p>If its fine with you, could you introduce me to the young nobles that will bear the future of Mount Hua?
Zhuge Sak looked at the three members of the Lotus Peak with interest and asked.
 Gu Pung answered that he could obviously do that and introduced Jang Hong first.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Ju Seo Cheon, whose introduction got put last, was looking at one place fixedly.</p>
<p>‘Hahaha!
He wanted to laugh out loud right now.</p>
<p>His excitement didnt settle down like before.</p>
<p>It had been like this ever since the name of the Zhuge Sega came out.
 A strange sense passed by his spine.</p>
<p>His eyes were still looking at that one person.</p>
<p>‘Honestly speaking, I wasnt even expecting you to be here.
 I just had my hopes.</p>
<p>He didnt know what happened in this generation but there were a big number of people that would be remembered as heroes.</p>
<p>Zhuge Sang, the one who would be called the Thousand Man Army in the future was one of the figures that represented those figures.</p>
<p>Zhuge Sang showed extraordinary abilities even before he turned thirty, while Murim was filled with war, and got recognized.</p>
<p>Zhuge Sangs skills and quality was recognized even before he inherited the Zhuge Sega family and became a commander of the Murim Association.</p>
<p>But he became a target of the enemy forces precisely because of his extraordinary abilities and got assassinated five years after he became a commander.</p>
<p>‘I was planning to somehow convince the merchant king after I met him to find you.</p>
<p>After that the position of commander of the Murim Association was inherited by his step sister, the beautiful schemer Zhuge Suran.</p>
<p>While Zhuge Sang was active, Zhuge Suran had assisted him by his side and her abilities werent normal either.</p>
<p>If Zhuge Sang was proficient at military tactics and strategies, Zhuge Suran was proficient at unseen schemes.</p>
<p>People saw these two and praised them for being connected deeper than anyone else, even though they were born from different bellies.</p>
<p>The countless strategies, tactics and schemes that came out from the Murim Association at the age of war came mostly from these two.</p>
<p>The world saw them and said that Zhuge Liang [1] was reborn after being separated as a man and woman.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the Beautiful Schemer managed to survive by being aware of the surroundings of the Thousand Man Army but she died when the age of war ended.</p>
<p>The cause of her death was ironically the same as the Thousand Man Army, assassination.
 She was that aware and careful but in the end she wasnt able to avoid it.</p>
<p>And one more person…
‘The Late Partner of Heaven, Zhuge Seung Kye!
He was the figure Ju Seo Cheon was looking for as the number one priority just like the merchant king.</p>
<p>He was a bit surprised when he heard the names of the Thousand Man Army and the Beautiful Schemer but he didnt think it was weird.</p>
<p>The two people were rumored to have a strong bond between brother and sister.
 He also knew long ago that the two of them had been together since they were young.</p>
<p>Also, the direct bloodline of the Zhuge Sega visited the nearbys of Kaiyang to check the situation so it was also understandable that they were here.</p>
<p>But that wasnt the case for Zhuge Seung Kye.
 He wasnt able to hide his surprise as soon as he saw him.</p>
<p>The Late Partner of Heaven, Zhuge Seung Kye, was not originally someone that would come to this kind of place.
 Originally, he was planning to entrust the merchant king or use another method to find him.</p>
<p>He did have his hopes when he heard that the Zhuge Sega were at Kaiyang, but he didnt raise his hopes too high.</p>
<p>Ju Seo Cheon also thought that there was no way for Zhuge Seung Kye to come to this place.</p>
<p>That is…because he was so incompetent that it was doubtful whether he would even be able to get out Hubei.</p>
<p>Tch tch, no matter how incompetent you are, you make people stifled and annoyed.
 Fix that attitude of yours.</p>
<p>When the introduction of the members of the Lotus Peak ended, Zhuge Sak clicked his tongue and looked at Zhuge Seung Kye as if he was pathetic.</p>
<p>Look at the young nobles of the Lotus Peak.
 They are this outstanding even though they are the same age as you.
 I wouldnt rebuke you like this if you were even half as competent as them.</p>
<p>Zhuge Seung Kye didnt say anything and just lowered his head.
 He had lowered it so low that they couldnt even see his face.</p>
<p>What the Sega requested from you isnt anything great.
 Just practice the basic energy circulation like everyone else, stop practicing something useless like the Art of Machinery and study the Fortune Telling Battle Tactics!
Gu Pung didnt know what to do.
 He had a really troubled expression.</p>
<p>Zhuge Sak didnt mind his surroundings at all and reprimanded Zhuge Seung Kye in his face.</p>
<p>Zhuge Seung Kye still held his head low and stood still without saying anything.
 He didnt even move.</p>
<p>Uh ahem.</p>
<p>It seemed like Zhuge Zaks excitement calmed down after having gotten angry for a long time and cleared his throat.</p>
<p>After that, he looked towards the side of Mount Huas group and apologized with a sorry face while scratching his head.</p>
<p>Im sorry for having shown such disgraceful behavior in front of the young nobles and the Fourteenth Gallant Sword.
 I just hoped that this kid would look at the members of the Lotus Peak of Mount Hua and reflect on it.</p>
<p>Its fine.</p>
<p>Gu Pung scratched his head and smiled bitterly.</p>
<p>The time we will be doing the mission together will be short but I hope you dont mind me and scold him as much as you want.
 Its a serious matter as he still hasnt gotten a hold of himself.
 He is completely useless right now but I hope he changes through this mission.</p>
<p>Zhuge Zak started to curse again.
 It was to the point that he made the people watching him exhausted.</p>
<p>This is all because of your actions! You brought this upon yourself.
 Thats why you are called the Poor and Weird Scholar!
He was weird for getting involved with things that didnt matter.</p>
<p>It was the nickname he had obtained before going out to Kang Ho.</p>
<p>He wasnt known in all of Kang Ho but at least that nickname was quite well known in Hubei, where Zhuge Sega was located.</p>
<p>It was an obvious thing but that nickname didnt mean anything good.</p>
<p>This was also the reason why Ju Seo Cheon hadnt been expecting Zhuge Seung Kye to come here.</p>
<p>The current treatment of Zhuge Seung Kye was the worst in Murim and even inside the Zhuge Sega.</p>
<p>‘Right, its unavoidable being treated like that.</p>
<p>The Arts of Machinery was a discarded technique.</p>
<p>It was to the point that Zhuge Sega turned their back on it.</p>
<p>The reason for that was that even the Second Generation of The Demonic Path neglected the Arts of Machinery.</p>
<p>If the enemy forces used it, they would have gained interest in it at least to take a grasp on the technique but that wasnt the case either.</p>
<p>In the end, both sides only left a small record about it and in the current age it was almost completely forgotten.</p>
<p>Studying in the Arts of Machinery was reason enough to get scolded at but on top of that Zhuge Seung Kye didnt even learn the martial arts of the Zhuge Sega family properly.</p>
<p>No, precisely speaking, he had tried to learn it but had no talent towards it.</p>
<p>The bloodline of the Zhuge Sega certainly had no talent towards studying the martial arts, compared to other martial artists.</p>
<p>In the first place, the Zhuge Sega was a family that had people with a more outstanding brain rather than body.</p>
<p>Honestly speaking, it didnt matter much if they werent good at martial arts.
 What the Zhuge Sega was proud of was their head, the Fortune Telling Battle Tactics, etc.</p>
<p>But Zhuge Seung Kye had no talent at all.
 He wasnt even at the level of a normal martial artist.</p>
<p>It was hard to even find someone with the worst talent like him, and as he didnt even study the Fortune Telling Battle Tactics it would be weirder if he didnt get cursed at.</p>
<p>Note from Imagine:

    <h1 id="the-s-classes-that-i-raised">The S-Classes That I Raised .</h1>
<p>&lt; Old Friends Starting Today .<br />
That slightly stooped man who looked like he’s been worn down by the vicissitudes of life had an acquisition failed skill that was no less than SS-Rank! It was obvious just from looking at the name that it was a special skill related to production.<br />
Wow, even 5 years later, not even one person came out with an equipment production skill.<br />
To think that I would see that here.<br />
Special skills were already normally rare, and after the Awakening Centers were made, they completely disappeared[1.<br />
This was because the Awakening Center’s Awakening method was to battle in a virtual reality.<br />
Later, virtual realities for healer use were made, but that was it.<br />
This was why Awakened People from the Awakening Center had 70% combat skills, and 29% healing skills.<br />
The remaining 1% were also mostly combat-assistance skills, and special skills were about one in a million.<br />
‘Anyways, awesome! Seriously awesome!’ If I raise that person, there was that issue of having to say that damned keyword, but it was too much of as waste to give up.<br />
First, thinking we should introduce ourselves to each other, I was going to go chase after the man going the opposite direction.<br />
Tap.<br />
The scruff of my neck grabbed.<br />
That guy Sunghan, treating me like some puppy[2, lightly picked me up and pulled me away, and said in a displeased voice.  </p>
<p>You’re trying to go somewhere again.<br />
Without saying anything.<br />
com I had to report on this too? It felt like I was a 5-year-old who came out to buy groceries with his mom.  </p>
<p>It’s just… I thought I saw someone I know.<br />
I was going to go say hello.<br />
So let me go.<br />
Sunghan let me go, telling me that I should tell him beforehand, and while that was happening, the SS skill acquisition failed man got that much further away.<br />
No, wait up.  </p>
<p>Hey! Myeongwoo!I yelled hard.<br />
Yoo Myeongwoo, who was about the turn around the corner, stopped and turned his head.<br />
I put on an extremely pleased expression and walked over to him in big strides.  </p>
<p>You’re Myeongwoo, right? Yoo Myeongwoo.<br />
It’s been so long!As I made a fuss and pretended I knew him, Yoo Myeongwoo was taken aback and searched my face.<br />
Of course, even if he looked, he wouldn’t know me.<br />
This was our very first meeting.<br />
Um… who were you.<br />
I’m sorry, but I can’t remember well……It’s okay.<br />
I don’t remember you either.  </p>
<p>You don’t remember? Han Yoojin, Yoojin.<br />
…Sorry.<br />
I really don’t remember.<br />
It’s been too long, so it makes sense.<br />
I wasn’t sure either.<br />
Have you been well all this time? Did you also Awaken?As I spoke, lightly hitting Yoo Myeongwoo’s shoulder, he put on a bashful expression.  </p>
<p>Yeah.<br />
F-Rank, though.<br />
Stats and skills both.<br />
My skills are E… but not enough to go into a dungeon.<br />
I just came to get the subsidy at least.<br />
com A weak smile flickered across Yoo Myeongwoo’s face.<br />
Even just looking, it seemed like he was in tough circumstances.  </p>
<p>I’m FE too! But we still get Hunter licenses.<br />
It’s a lot better than FF.<br />
I whispered the last part.<br />
At my words, Yoo Myeongwoo showed a slightly brighter smile.  </p>
<p>Since you’re FE, you must have requested a basics program?At my question, he shook his head.  </p>
<p>No.<br />
I didn’t.<br />
The training expenses are free but they said I had to pay boarding costs every week… The basics program doesn’t give out subsidies, and with my abilities, I don’t think I’ll be able to attack any dungeons, so I might as well use the time to job-hunt.<br />
I thought of me before the regression.<br />
If it weren’t for my debts, I might have also given up and run around the job front unremarkably.<br />
Since going and attacking a dungeon with only E-Rank buff skills was a really stupid thing to do.<br />
So I…… sold the Haeyeon Guild Leader and got party members.<br />
It was definitely a scam, and my reputation definitely hit rock bottom.<br />
Back then, rather than helping out, I cursed out Yoohyun a lot, saying I would turn him away.<br />
Let’s self-reflect.<br />
I shouldn’t do that again… but rather, even now I was still constantly lying.<br />
Still, it’s a waste.<br />
Do you want to get training with me at my guild.<br />
Hm? Your guild-.<br />
Han Yoojin-ssi.<br />
Kim Sunghan, who was silently standing a bit apart from us, cut in with a frown.<br />
Yoo Myeongwoo, who had only just noticed him, shrunk his neck like a frightened turtle.  </p>
<p>Only guild members can receive rookie Hunter training.<br />
Ah[3, can’t you stick in just one little person[4.<br />
And his personality is good.<br />
Kind and really good with his hands.<br />
You’re like this because you don’t know, but this guy was really awesome.<br />
He was a completely genuine person, but I couldn’t explain.  </p>
<p>But-.<br />
Then I’ll ask Yoohyun, and if he says no, I’ll give up.<br />
com As soon as I took out my cell phone, Kim Sunghan was floored.  </p>
<p>He’s busy.<br />
If he doesn’t pick up the phone, then later-.<br />
[What is it? Did you finish the Awakened Person registration? Yoohyun picked up the phone after just two rings.<br />
It was fast.  </p>
<p>Yeah.<br />
I finished.<br />
I bought contracts too.<br />
But can you let my friend participate in Haeyeon Guild’s rookie Hunter training?[Friend? Besides that, let him receive Hunter training?.<br />
Wouldn’t receiving it be better? Just in case.<br />
[Hmm.<br />
Okay.<br />
I’ll send out word.<br />
Some guy completely shook down my house so where else would I go.<br />
Yoohyun laughed.<br />
Don’t laugh, you brat.<br />
If you broke even one cup, I’ll file for compensation… or rather, I’ve already gotten a billion won.  </p>
<p>It’s fine, right?I looked up at Kim Sunghan after hanging up the phone.<br />
His unhappy expression was obvious but he didn’t say anything and stepped back a couple of steps.  </p>
<p>Say, Haeyeon Guild’s Guild Leader, how do you.<br />
He’s my dongsaeng.<br />
Yoo Myeongwoo’s eyes were full of awe and envy.<br />
Our Yoohyun is pretty impressive, huh, haha.  </p>
<p>If you complete the Guild, not Association, rookie training, it’s a lot easier to get party members.<br />
For F-Rank beginner dungeons, stats and skills are about the same so experience is the most important.<br />
What initial skills did you get.<br />
Whetstone.<br />
It gives 2% more sharpness to weapons that have blades.<br />
So it’s a weapon buff skill.<br />
It’s definitely vague.<br />
Still, you can endure up to D-Rank with equipment.<br />
Should I lend you one?If you plastered C-Rank equipment on yourself, F-Ranks could go around E-Rank dungeons.<br />
I was also F-Rank, but I’ve been to even D-Rank dungeons.<br />
Though I was nearly killed by the Lauchtas.<br />
But it’s hard to cover dungeons starting from C-Rank with just equipment.  </p>
<p>E-equipment…?Yoo Myeongwoo had an astonished expression.<br />
Well, for Hunter equipment, even F-Ranks went for hundreds of thousands of won.<br />
To depend on equipment, you had to wear one that was higher than your own rank, and then you could beat a dungeon as easy as breathing[5.<br />
For example, I spent several hundred millions to buy equipment.<br />
It was obvious that readily lending something like that was shocking.<br />
I put on my kindest smile with all my might.  </p>
<p>I can’t go into dungeons often anyways.<br />
But isn’t it a waste to leave it unused? I’m just lending you something that’s idle so don’t worry about it.<br />
You really don’t have to worry! And you’re a good guy.<br />
A really good guy.<br />
He was a talent whose skill was so so good that it had two S’s.<br />
If Yoo Myeongwoo’s skills were discovered, then would a few equipment be a problem; if he waved a contract filled with all sorts of conditions, the whole world would come running.  </p>
<p>At least, I think you definitely have enough value to receive this kind of treatment, so just accept it.<br />
There’s nothing bad about it, right.<br />
R-Really…It looked like Yoo Myeongwoo’s two eyes were squinting when, Plop plop[6 Large drops of tears[7 fell.<br />
Uh, oh[8?.<br />
Really, I… am someone with value.<br />
T-that’s right.<br />
I do think that.<br />
Uhheuheuk-![9Yoo Myeongwoo started to cry as if a swelling dam had burst.<br />
He wailed as he made hitching noises.<br />
W-what do I do? Should I comfort him?.<br />
…A lot must have built up all this time.<br />
As I clumsily patted his stooped back, he let out a sob and suddenly pulled me over to hug me.<br />
Hey, hey.<br />
Calm down a little.<br />
It was really embarrassing.<br />
With a plop, a paper cup fell from a vending machine.<br />
Then coffee filled the cup.<br />
I took out the coffee and looked at Yoo Myeongwoo who was sipping coix seed tea.<br />
His face was wretched.<br />
Of course, both his eyes were blood-shot, and not just his face but even his nape was red with heat.<br />
His appearance, caked with tear tracks, looked like that of a begger who was completely beat up and chased out, but his expression looked a lot more refreshed.<br />
Have you calmed down a little now?Sitting on a bench next to the vending machine, he bashfully nodded his head.<br />
I took a sip of coffee as I sat down next to him on the bench.<br />
What use is there to be able to tell the difference between coffee bean varieties, vending machine coffee was the best.  </p>
<p>I won a lot of awards when I was young, remember?Yoo Myeongwoo opened his mouth, while looking at someone taking a walk behind the Association building.<br />
The weather was quite nice.  </p>
<p>Like you said, I was really good with my hands.<br />
Yeah, I know.<br />
The best.<br />
If the talent was good enough to get a SS-Rank production skill, then it definitely was.  </p>
<p>But it’s useless for living.<br />
When I was young, people would say ‘you’re doing great’, but when my head got a little bigger, they’d say to stop playing around and study.<br />
And that I have to do well on tests, and go to a good college, and get a good job.<br />
There was no time for the talent I got praised for, and such.<br />
He continued in a calm voice.<br />
If my family’s circumstances were better off, I might’ve been able to find a path using my talent.<br />
But there was no breathing room.<br />
I didn’t have a talent for studying, and after going to a so-so college, I just had a lot of debt.<br />
College branded[10, grades branded.<br />
After that, I found I didn’t have anywhere to go.<br />
With his sigh, there was a bitter taste in my mouth.<br />
I also knew it well, that.<br />
Even before Awakened People and Hunters appeared, the world also had ranks.<br />
They didn’t openly hand out S to F, but ranks were assigned as soon as you were born.<br />
The so-called gold spoon and dirt spoon[11.<br />
Just like Awakening stat ranks, you were different from the start.<br />
Of course, there were people born into a poor family who made their own fortunes.<br />
But the majority stayed the same.<br />
Even if you tried, you wouldn’t be able to rise much and most had to stop.<br />
‘Would initial skills be talents?’ If the circumstances don’t measure up, a talent doesn’t bloom in the end.<br />
Like how everyone pushes you to study and divides you in ranks[12, the Awakening Center would also push you toward combat or healing and choose ranks.<br />
In the end, even SS-Rank skills like Yoo Myeongwoo’s in front of me would be buried and disappear.<br />
As a Hunter, F-Rank, to society, F-Rank.<br />
com for the best novel reading experience Ah, I want to crack open a bottle of soju[13~.  </p>
<p>It’s been a long time since my parents divorced, and I’m a useless bum.<br />
Do you know how I Awakened? I was trying to kill myself.<br />
Yoo Myeongwoo giggled.<br />
It was more serious than I’d thought.  </p>
<p>I was cutting my wrist with a knife when I Awakened.<br />
Ah, I’ll get a million won.<br />
With that thought, I felt relieved.<br />
A million won.<br />
It wasn’t a little, but it wasn’t a lot either.<br />
It was an amount that would disappear through living expenses in a couple of months if you didn’t have a decent job.<br />
…I wonder what happened to the Yoo Myeongwoo before my regression.<br />
Only briefly happy after getting the million won, as an F-Rank with assistance skills that he couldn’t go around a dungeon properly with, just how much longer would he have survived?.<br />
With the million won, I can eat properly for once.<br />
And… after that I didn’t really think of anything so I was just going to let things happen on its own.<br />
But you told me.<br />
He said while crumpling the empty paper cup.  </p>
<p>That I have value.<br />
That I should continue living, that a path is set out for me, that I deserve a hand held out, that I have kind of value, so it’s okay.<br />
com …With that, he might cry again.<br />
I uselessly cleared my throat.<br />
I was just trying to hit jackpot but now I was starting to feel ashamed.  </p>
<p>I don’t act like that with just anyone.<br />
I was like that because you’re really a great guy.<br />
Thanks.<br />
Really.<br />
Yoo Myeongwoo rubbed away tears that were starting to form again with his fist.<br />
The atmosphere was quite good.<br />
If it wasn’t now, another good opportunity might not appear.<br />
Fine, let’s do this.  </p>
<p>Our lives were sort of miserable.<br />
Mine wasn’t smooth either.<br />
After my parents passed, trying to survive with my dongsaeng, I had to quit school.<br />
Still, my dongsaeng was lucky to Awaken as S-Rank, but I’m a lowly F-Rank.<br />
To tell you the truth, I was re~ally jealous of my dongsaeng.<br />
As I was talking, I unconsciously bared my heart.  </p>
<p>Still.<br />
Other people sneer at you saying that you ruined your life.<br />
We don’t have to put ourselves down as well, right? It’s hard enough to live when you have confidence, if you’re timid then you get into trouble[14.<br />
If your mind becomes a mess because your life is a mess, you’ll fall lower than rock bottom.<br />
Just by throwing out my inferiority complex, my life changed a lot.<br />
Is there any need to break our necks looking up? Just live thinking ‘I’m actually amazing, others just don’t recognize it’.<br />
And loving yourself.<br />
I love this amazing me!Rather than meaninglessly working hard for nothing[15, a mental victory is better.<br />
Smiling exaggeratedly, I looked at Yoo Myeongwoo.  </p>
<p>Yoo Myeongwoo, I love you too, my friend!That guy laughed and I laughed.<br />
A Messaged Window popped up.<br />
[Awakened Person ‘Yoo Myeongwoo’ has been influenced by the keyword! [1 lit.<br />
‘as if the seed has dried up’ [2 개새끼, 개 = dog, 새끼 = (lit.<br />
) offspring – but remember how it’s also an insult? Yeah, 개새끼 also means something like ‘son of a bitch’ [3 the actual sound is ‘ey-ee’ (or like the letter ‘a’) which is a sound you make when you’re (often playfully) refuting something.<br />
There’s no eng equivalent that I can think of, but the sound itself sounds like ‘ey’ which has a… different meaning in eng, so I just replaced it with something else [4 the actual word means something like ‘someone who isn’t involved but keeps on inserting themselves’ but that’s a little awkward to put in so I just used a similar eng phrase ‘one little person’.<br />
Ok I know they’re not that similar but I did my best.<br />
comAdvertisements [5 lit.  </p>
<p>several hundreds to more than a thousand [times lightly[6 ‘too-deuk’ in krn [7 lit.<br />
‘tears like chicken droppings’ [8 ‘uh-ra’ = a sound that’s used in situations like ‘what do we have here’‘oh?’‘huh?’ [9 crying noises [10 in the old days, people who did something bad were branded somewhere obvious (I think on their face?) as punishment and to let other people know they are bad.<br />
He’s referring to that.<br />
[11 gold spoon refers to what is called ‘silver spoon’ in eng (as in ‘born with a silver spoon in one’s mouth’) and you can guess what dirt spoon would mean, then [12 in korea, at least up to my parents’ gen, idk about now, schools would rank their students according to their grades (as in, the best student is 1, 2nd best is 2, etc.<br />
) [13 Korean rice winealcohol, though nowadays it’s also made with non-rice starches.<br />
[14 lit.  </p>
<p>roll in mud[15 lit.  </p>

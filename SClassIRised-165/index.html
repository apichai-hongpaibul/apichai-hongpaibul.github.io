<p>147 Part 3.<br />
We do not want much, and just want to have MKC’s shares.<br />
Simyeong Seok spoke as if he had been waiting for the chance.  </p>
<p>You know that the Association is covering for MKC, whose reputation has fallen for a series of mistakes under the justification of balancing large-sized guilds.<br />
We want to fix that.<br />
Are you saying that you want us to endorse Haeyeon in exchange for getting into the Association again.<br />
There’s no need for that.<br />
Simyeong Seok slowly smiled, and his gaze flickered to Yoohyun, who was sitting next to me.  </p>
<p>We have three S class hunters and a deep connection to the monster breeding facility.<br />
We have already overshadowed MKC regarding growth possibilities, and just want fair treatment.<br />
He confidently spoke, that would be enough.  </p>
<p>It’s astoundingly unfair that the number of dungeons we manage, and the quota of item prioritization rights are the same as when we only had one S class hunter.<br />
Since Sesung also has more S class hunters, adjustments should be made extensively.<br />
com Simyeong Seok clucked his tongue that the higher up in the Association did not listen.<br />
He then fluently explained the potential Haeyeon had and how much they would help manage the dungeons safely in detail.<br />
He was planning to raise Haeyeon right below Sesung.<br />
While Haeyeon could be the top if you only consider the number of S class hunters, Sesung’s second S class hunter had an exclusive team right after coming to Korea.<br />
On the other hand, Haeyeon S class hunters still did not have their own teams, which meant that they were still behind.<br />
While there were differences in other fields, Haeyeon should be evaluated above MKC and Breaker regarding the strength of its hunters.  </p>
<p>We agree with your statement that the Association has been unfair in some parts.<br />
However, we will forget the fact we had the conversation here.<br />
Eunyoung Choi cut off the conversation, and others had similar expressions.<br />
It would be better for us, but there would still be traces of what had been spoken here.<br />
Memories cannot be erased, and since they knew that there was a discriminatory problem, it would be prioritized over other issues.<br />
At the same time, they would think that Haeyeon’s sudden growth was inevitable.<br />
While it was a simple truth, they would be more lenient with Haeyeon’s shares on dungeons and item ownership.  </p>
<p>Then, let’s talk about how we would take care of these men.<br />
The six men who had been picking at the food now grew rigid, and the six individuals across the table glared at them.<br />
The nation erupted again from the early morning.<br />
[An intentional dungeon break! It had been only three years from the dungeon shock, and most people remembered the hurt that had come with it.<br />
Simultaneously, dungeon breaks were ongoing disasters.<br />
The fact that someone had deliberately triggered one angered the entire nation.<br />
com [The Director of Dungeon Management Headquarters acknowledges being involved in illegal dungeon transactions! [Did the Vice President of the Hunter Association know about the trafficking of the rewards of an A class dungeon, nicknamed The Hive?! [The board members of the Hunter Association resign to take responsibility for the ‘Hive Situation.<br />
’ [Who would take the place of the previous Director of Dungeon Management Headquarters, who has been taken into emergency custody? [The past and the present of the Hunter Association.<br />
Why had the members been replaced? [The corruption of the Hunter Association continues to emerge! Sweet honey had allured pests.<br />
Newspapers and television spoke about this issue for days.<br />
People who had made a deal with me resigned with a written apology for responsibility.<br />
While they had avoided harsh criticism, the six who had been caught and others involved were taken into custody.<br />
While there were no relevant laws since nothing like this had happened before, I heard that it was highly probable that they would be charged with crimes on the level of overthrowing the state.<br />
It was only luck that the casualties had been just a few, so a death row sentence would not be farfetched.<br />
‘I hope the new personnel does not cause problems.<br />
com It would be easy to remove them just in case since I had the contracts, but I hoped I would not have to use them.<br />
Please do not rot for about five years.<br />
Since I replaced the basics, I wanted to mediate the misaligned relationship between the Awakened Office and the Association.<br />
Should I do something? Can’t things work out on their own? However, Taewon Song should not be relegated to cleaning up messes.<br />
I felt this all the more firmly after briefly experiencing his powers.<br />
His looting skill would be fantastic if nurtured, and he would not lose one-on-one fights if the range expanded a bit.<br />
If only he had an environment where he could get the proper equipment and train himself.<br />
Of course, Taewon Song would refuse all this.<br />
Should I try to apply a keyword?.<br />
Comet! You took my glasses again!Comet was awake during the day recently, and it grabbed my glasses and flew up.<br />
I quickly reached out but only felt air.<br />
Where did it go? I could not see it.<br />
-Peep!.<br />
Hey, don’t come near my feet! The table.<br />
Be careful, big brother.<br />
Yoohyun came to give my glasses back to me.<br />
Comet indignantly fluttered as Yoohyun held it in his hand.<br />
The glasses were proving to be inconvenient, and maybe lenses would be a better choice.<br />
When will your eyesight return to normal.<br />
Maybe soon if I rest.<br />
Yoohyun furrowed his brow at my words.<br />
I rested without doing anything yesterday but needed to go out today.<br />
I received information that Riette had come out after finishing the dungeon conquest.  </p>

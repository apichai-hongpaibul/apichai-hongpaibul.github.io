<p>151 Part 2.<br />
Yes, I’m all right.<br />
But…I was going to say that families worked it out but stopped when I remembered Noah’s situation.<br />
I smiled again, and Noah slowly changed into his dragon form.<br />
-However, Hunter Yoohyun Han’s worry for you is real.<br />
So, it really is all right then?.<br />
Of course, my brother’s dependable.<br />
Noah circled twice above our heads and flew away.  </p>
<p>Why are you so tense when there wasn’t much trouble?Things had been comparatively uneventful, as we only stopped Riette and Soyoung Kang from going out on a drive.<br />
An arm made me turn behind, and my brother’s face looked hazy like a picture doused in water.  </p>
<p>How can you say that? You said your fear resistance levels are low.<br />
com Yoohyun spoke like he really could not understand, and I had to agree that normal people would consider today a chaotic one.  </p>
<p>I still have a C class, which would be enough for everyday fear.<br />
I probably could wave at a tiger that opened its mouth at me, since a C class monster was stronger.<br />
Of course, fear could not be classified into levels since people feared different things.<br />
There might be people who did not fear tigers without a fear resistance skill but would need a C class to walk past a spider calmly.<br />
Also, I was used to scenes like this today since the world was also hostile to lower class hunters.<br />
If I was not injured, that meant things had gone well.  </p>
<p>I’m really.  </p>
<p>Stop saying that you’re all right.<br />
You can’t see well but came out anyway despite this being a problem that could have been solved without you.<br />
Riette would have ambushed the detention center in which the former director is in.<br />
Even if that happened, you don’t need to be responsible for that or any others.<br />
Why can’t you ignore these things.<br />
…Because I hadn’t been able to do anything.<br />
com I had let go of enough things, a lot of them.<br />
I could see my face clearly even when I closed my eyes, and I canceled the teacher’s skill because the sight gave me chills.  </p>
<p>You also did more than you can.<br />
I spoke to him while trying to calm myself.  </p>
<p>You’re only twenty.<br />
He had been twenty-five and crazy.<br />
Yoohyun had been the one to begin a self-sacrificing streak, and now he was asking about responsibility.<br />
He had given his life and went over his head, and took on every burden he could.  </p>
<p>Hyung.<br />
No, I’ll try not to make you anxious.<br />
Yoohyun did not know it now, since he did not do it and would not do it.<br />
I would not let it happen.  </p>
<p>I don’t want that.<br />
Yoohyun.  </p>
<p>You’re trying to do everything by yourself no matter what I say.<br />
What did you say just now? You say that you’ll try not to make me anxious? You’re deciding things on yourself again.<br />
However, you had and your scale had been bigger too.<br />
I did not speak out since it had not been Yoohyun in front of me who had done it, as he had only just started.<br />
He closed his mouth, and I could guess his expression.  </p>
<p>You’re going to the Sesung Guild, right.<br />
Yes, Ms.<br />
Soyoung Kang asked me that favor, too.<br />
Let’s go.<br />
Yoohyun stepped forward before coming back to me.  </p>
<p>Be careful.<br />
The ground is all messed up.<br />
While his voice was still angry, his hand was gentle as it grabbed my arm.<br />
com *** Since Sesung had not finished the S class dungeon conquest, Hyunjae Sung was said to be unavailable to the public.  </p>
<p>Is it all right for someone who should be in a dungeon to come out to the rooftop garden? I heard that reporters flew nowadays.<br />
My shooting skills are adequate.<br />
Hyunjae Sung spoke as he enjoyed a relaxing teatime amidst scenery that looked like a picture of a green summer forest.  </p>
<p>Don’t worry, since I won’t let them get away.<br />
You’re sweet to think of that.<br />
Sweet? Are you confessing that you have shot in the city? I should call the police.<br />
Are your eyes the same?Hyunjae Sung had come near me to look down on my eyes.<br />
I was even more surprised when he grabbed and lifted me up.<br />
You lost weight.<br />
Yoohyun’s management skills must have been low.<br />
I don’t see it as staying home.<br />
Rather than resting, he’s raising monsters almost all day long.<br />
My brother and Hyunjae Sung treated me like they had brought a pet to an animal hospital.<br />
I know because I had worked part-time in one.<br />
A doctor would look over at me, converse with the owner, weigh the patient, and lift him on the table to feed medicine or give a shot.<br />
Hyunjae Sung sat me down on the table, and the tea smelled nice.<br />
I would not take medicine and would refuse a shot, but I would not bite like a dog.  </p>
<p>So…take care of him for a while.<br />
My brother spoke nonsense, and Hyunjae Sung also looked surprised.<br />
I needed glasses.  </p>
<p>What do you mean, take care? Am I a pet? I have to take care of Mr.<br />
Noah.<br />
It’s only for a short while.<br />
Everyone has noticed the fact you have health problems.<br />
Since you don’t rest at home nor listen to me, stay here since I’m going to act as Minyui Kim now.<br />
I’ll send the chick to you.<br />
Hey, are you going to bury Hunter Minyui Kim for good?!His image had already been improved too much.<br />
My brother ignored me and held out a contract.<br />
I’ll think this is for the auction ticket I passed on to you in March.<br />
I can’t take compensation for taking care of my item.<br />
He’s mine.<br />
I had said I would hand myself over to him if I were an item, but Yoohyun was too confident.<br />
I still had rights as a human being, you know.<br />
The two did not listen to a word I said and set a specific contract, and my brother went after saying to wait still.<br />
What was going on!.<br />
Will you have some sweets.<br />
No.<br />
Please pull back before I bite.  </p>

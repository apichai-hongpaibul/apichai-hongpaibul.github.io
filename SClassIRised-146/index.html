<p>Chapter 139 A Shard Within (1).<br />
With only a B class hunter as your bodyguard, there might be a third attempt to kidnap you today.<br />
Yoohyun laughed while he respectfully held an umbrella over my head.<br />
He would look like Hunter Minyui Kim to other people.  </p>
<p>If there are people who try to take such a foolish chance, I’ll burn their roots as a welcome.<br />
So please don’t worry.<br />
You’re a dependable person like my brother.<br />
I walked along while trying to stifle my laughter.<br />
Other hunters worried over me and continued to ask if I was all right with only a B class hunter as I went to the parking lot.  </p>
<p>Hunter Minyui Kim is more than enough.<br />
The hunters looked at Yoohyun with surprised eyes.<br />
While Minyui Kim had a useful skill, he was only a B class supporter who had officially met me for the first time.<br />
It would be strange for me to trust him.<br />
However, I did not want to be indifferent to him and thought it would be useful to raise Minyui’s value.<br />
After all, I was the person to be connected with nowadays.<br />
Minyui Kim’s car was a small and yellow foreign compact model, and his novice driver sign had a character on it.<br />
Even his air freshener is cute.<br />
There was a famous children’s character mini-doll hanging on one side.<br />
I wondered whether kids nowadays liked this sort of thing, and remembering Yoohyun’s bleak car saddened me a little.  </p>
<p>Do you have a hobby.<br />
A hobby? No.<br />
Yoohyun replied while turning on the engine.  </p>
<p>You really don’t have anything you want to do and the like.<br />
I didn’t have time to think of such things.<br />
Yoohyun’s quiet reply made me think my question was an unnecessary one.<br />
However, my brother might have the time to find a hobby if his surroundings allowed it in the future.<br />
He should not become Hyunjae Sung or Riette.<br />
There were not any S classes from birth that would serve as a suitable example, and I might have to count on the other two.<br />
‘I have to search for them anyway.<br />
Please let them be the right people.<br />
com for a better experience My life was already going crazy, and I needed a break now.<br />
Riette would appear soon, and I might have to meet her with my lowered fear resistance.<br />
The thought made my head spin.<br />
I first replaced my broken cell phone.<br />
While the television and the Internet moved on to new issues, people inside and outside of the communication service branch store [still recognized who I was.<br />
A grandmother held my hand and told me I had gone through much trouble.<br />
I had my USIM chip replaced in embarrassment and called our dear Sesung Guild Leader after getting back to the car.<br />
However, he did not answer for once.<br />
Was he busy? I called him again to no avail, so I changed tactics and tried to get Soyoung Kang on the phone.<br />
[Hello, Mr.<br />
Yoojin Han!.<br />
Hello, Ms.<br />
Soyoung.<br />
Do you know where Sesung Guild Leader is? He’s not answering the phone.<br />
[Guild Leader is um, officially conquering a dungeon right now.  </p>
<p>I met him last night.<br />
The association lapped it up since they wanted the credit, and yesterday’s processing of the dungeon break was said to be by association hunters headed by Taewon Song on television.<br />
I had not seen another hunter, although it would have been bothersome if they had come even though they had been notified that an S class monster appeared.<br />
There was no healer present anyway.<br />
com [Oh, you did.<br />
I did not know that because you were not mentioned.<br />
It’s no surprise since when our Guild Leader moves without prior notice nowadays, his actions have to do something with you on a 99% average.<br />
Was I that bad? I did act on a whim often, and someone like Hyunjae Sung would move on a planned schedule.<br />
[Would you come to the guild? I’ll get in touch with him.  </p>
<p>Yes, thank you.<br />
We should tie up the ends as soon as possible.<br />
I called Taewon Song after I ended the phone, but he did not answer.<br />
He probably was still unable to replace his phone, as his cards would have become unusable.  </p>
<p>Let’s go to Sesung.<br />
I know we are not up to their level, but I’m still pissed off.<br />
I wish you wouldn’t have to go there.<br />
Yoohyun turned the handle while he continued to grumble.<br />
While Haeyeon Guild would match Sesung regarding domestic dungeon conquering abilities when we assembled an S class team with Yerim, we were still far behind in other fields.<br />
Of course, a guild founded by a teenager going this far was an impressive feat in itself.  </p>
<p>You’re only twenty.<br />
How can a minor who started from scratch catch up to an adult who already carved his place in society in such a short time? I heard that the Sesung Guild Leader was going places even before his awakening.<br />
I know that he did not have any trouble with funds.<br />
Do you know what he did?I had no personal interest regarding Hyunjae Sung, but I was curious.<br />
Did he really have foreign blood in him? He would have stood out before awakening as a hunter if he had lived in Korea.<br />
Since I did not have any information, there was a high possibility of him having been abroad.  </p>
<p>I don’t know, and I have no reason to know.<br />
I can’t say to be on friendly terms with him as he is also an S class hunter, but he is a good business associate.<br />
He was special, and Yoohyun could learn how to be a better guild leader.  </p>
<p>Don’t become friends.<br />
You might pick up something bad.<br />
I’m not friends with him.<br />
Yeah, Ms.<br />
Hyuna Moon would be the best bet to be friends within the guild leaders.<br />
Noah and Ms.<br />
Soyoung would make good friends.<br />
It’s best to be friends with someone your age, and you should ignore old men.<br />
com I felt better when I thought of them in the same place, including Yerim.<br />
It was a fresh and comforting sight.  </p>
<p>When we finish up this.<br />
It was then Yoohyun reached out to me with his hand.<br />
A longsword burst out and ripped my seatbelt.<br />
The blade spun over my head to penetrate the car door and became embedded on the road.<br />
Then I heard a loud screeching noise of tires hitting the ground, and something crashed into the yellow compact car.<br />
At the same time, Yoohyun’s sword absorbed the impact of the crash and struck out at the car that had hit us.  </p>

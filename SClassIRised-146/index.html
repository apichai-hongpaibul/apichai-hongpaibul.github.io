<p>Chapter 139 A Shard Within (1) 
With only a B class hunter as your bodyguard, there might be a third attempt to kidnap you today.
Yoohyun laughed while he respectfully held an umbrella over my head.
He would look like Hunter Minyui Kim to other people.</p>
<p>If there are people who try to take such a foolish chance, I’ll burn their roots as a welcome.
So please don’t worry.
You’re a dependable person like my brother.
I walked along while trying to stifle my laughter.
Other hunters worried over me and continued to ask if I was all right with only a B class hunter as I went to the parking lot.</p>
<p>Hunter Minyui Kim is more than enough.
The hunters looked at Yoohyun with surprised eyes.
While Minyui Kim had a useful skill, he was only a B class supporter who had officially met me for the first time.
It would be strange for me to trust him.
However, I did not want to be indifferent to him and thought it would be useful to raise Minyui’s value.
After all, I was the person to be connected with nowadays.
Minyui Kim’s car was a small and yellow foreign compact model, and his novice driver sign had a character on it.
Even his air freshener is cute.
There was a famous children’s character mini-doll hanging on one side.
I wondered whether kids nowadays liked this sort of thing, and remembering Yoohyun’s bleak car saddened me a little.</p>
<p>Do you have a hobby?
A hobby? No.
Yoohyun replied while turning on the engine.</p>
<p>You really don’t have anything you want to do and the like?
I didn’t have time to think of such things.
Yoohyun’s quiet reply made me think my question was an unnecessary one.
However, my brother might have the time to find a hobby if his surroundings allowed it in the future.
He should not become Hyunjae Sung or Riette.
There were not any S classes from birth that would serve as a suitable example, and I might have to count on the other two.
‘I have to search for them anyway.
Please let them be the right people.
com for a better experience My life was already going crazy, and I needed a break now.
Riette would appear soon, and I might have to meet her with my lowered fear resistance.
The thought made my head spin.
I first replaced my broken cell phone.
While the television and the Internet moved on to new issues, people inside and outside of the communication service branch store [still recognized who I was.
A grandmother held my hand and told me I had gone through much trouble.
I had my USIM chip replaced in embarrassment and called our dear Sesung Guild Leader after getting back to the car.
However, he did not answer for once.
Was he busy? I called him again to no avail, so I changed tactics and tried to get Soyoung Kang on the phone.
[Hello, Mr.
Yoojin Han! 
Hello, Ms.
Soyoung.
Do you know where Sesung Guild Leader is? He’s not answering the phone.
[Guild Leader is um, officially conquering a dungeon right now.</p>
<p>I met him last night.
The association lapped it up since they wanted the credit, and yesterday’s processing of the dungeon break was said to be by association hunters headed by Taewon Song on television.
I had not seen another hunter, although it would have been bothersome if they had come even though they had been notified that an S class monster appeared.
There was no healer present anyway.
com [Oh, you did.
I did not know that because you were not mentioned.
It’s no surprise since when our Guild Leader moves without prior notice nowadays, his actions have to do something with you on a 99% average.
Was I that bad? I did act on a whim often, and someone like Hyunjae Sung would move on a planned schedule.
[Would you come to the guild? I’ll get in touch with him.</p>
<p>Yes, thank you.
We should tie up the ends as soon as possible.
I called Taewon Song after I ended the phone, but he did not answer.
He probably was still unable to replace his phone, as his cards would have become unusable.</p>
<p>Let’s go to Sesung.
I know we are not up to their level, but I’m still pissed off.
I wish you wouldn’t have to go there.
Yoohyun turned the handle while he continued to grumble.
While Haeyeon Guild would match Sesung regarding domestic dungeon conquering abilities when we assembled an S class team with Yerim, we were still far behind in other fields.
Of course, a guild founded by a teenager going this far was an impressive feat in itself.</p>
<p>You’re only twenty.
How can a minor who started from scratch catch up to an adult who already carved his place in society in such a short time? I heard that the Sesung Guild Leader was going places even before his awakening.
I know that he did not have any trouble with funds.
Do you know what he did?I had no personal interest regarding Hyunjae Sung, but I was curious.
Did he really have foreign blood in him? He would have stood out before awakening as a hunter if he had lived in Korea.
Since I did not have any information, there was a high possibility of him having been abroad.</p>
<p>I don’t know, and I have no reason to know.
I can’t say to be on friendly terms with him as he is also an S class hunter, but he is a good business associate.
He was special, and Yoohyun could learn how to be a better guild leader.</p>
<p>Don’t become friends.
You might pick up something bad.
I’m not friends with him.
Yeah, Ms.
Hyuna Moon would be the best bet to be friends within the guild leaders.
Noah and Ms.
Soyoung would make good friends.
It’s best to be friends with someone your age, and you should ignore old men.
com I felt better when I thought of them in the same place, including Yerim.
It was a fresh and comforting sight.</p>
<p>When we finish up this-
It was then Yoohyun reached out to me with his hand.
A longsword burst out and ripped my seatbelt.
The blade spun over my head to penetrate the car door and became embedded on the road.
Then I heard a loud screeching noise of tires hitting the ground, and something crashed into the yellow compact car.
At the same time, Yoohyun’s sword absorbed the impact of the crash and struck out at the car that had hit us.</p>

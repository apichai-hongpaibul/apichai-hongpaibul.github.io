<p>Chapter 134: Being Drawn(4).<br />
You, how did you….<br />
My legs gave up as I tried to vocalize.<br />
It was as if all the side effects have overwhelmed me at once.<br />
Yoohyun’s arms took a hold of me, preventing me from plopping down… The little lizard was already taking on a human shape.<br />
It wasn’t a perfect human form.<br />
It was a shape forged in fire like Iryn or Ismuir.  </p>
<p>…Such a thing is possible too….<br />
– Maybe, I can credit it to the events in Hong Kong.<br />
However, it will be too burdensome to use it for a long time.  </p>
<p>Too burdensome? How so?– First, my real body will be defenseless….  </p>
<p>Are you crazy, Han Yoohyun! Go back in right now! You, you are in the middle of attacking an S-level dungeon!– Don’t worry.<br />
It’s safer to be inside where there are only Guild members than being outside.<br />
Besides, there are other two S-levels, too.<br />
Besides, Fiz and Park Yaerim will take good care of me because of you.<br />
The little brother spoke nonchalantly, but my heart ached as my concerns grew.<br />
It was not easy to leave the spirit far behind, so it was made such that he would wake up if Eunhae was to respond while sleeping.<br />
Then there was the scar on the chest that should not be seen.<br />
I did hide it as soon as Yoohyun’s voice was heard though.<br />
com – A perfect fairy tale can only be maintained for less than thirty minutes or so.<br />
Iryn, too, will fall back to sleep.<br />
So, contact the leader of the Saesung Guild.<br />
Yoonhyun spoke while watching Song Taewon who was dusting the fire off that might have caught onto his clothes.  </p>
<p>Sung Hyunjae should be inside the dungeon still?– He just came back this morning after having been in Hong Kong for work.<br />
It is the Eblin Hunter that went into the dungeon.<br />
It was another one of Saesung’s S-level hunter that launched the attack, rather than Sung Hyunjae.<br />
Not sure what he has been up to, but it sounded like he was keeping Haeyeon informed as promised.  </p>
<p>Hm, as I have determined to stay away from Sung Hyunjae for about three days, it may be difficult for me to keep in touch….<br />
Noah is also in the vicinity.<br />
– Noah Hunter is not enough.<br />
The leader Song Taewon is the one who has the most battle experience with S-level hunters in the country.<br />
Furthermore, being a man-to-man combat specialist, I don’t think he would even last three minutes being an auxiliary type.<br />
Three minutes, that’s crazy.<br />
Still, I didn’t feel like encountering Sung Hyunjae at the moment.<br />
Swallowing my dry mouth, I looked at Song Taewon.<br />
Sudden chill went down my spine as our eyes met.<br />
– Contact’em now.<br />
com Yoohyun said as he was forging a spear in fire.<br />
From his low toned voice, there was a glimmering sense of nervousness.<br />
– Not sure what had happened, but it doesn’t look like things will just pass.<br />
At the same time, Song Taewon began to move.<br />
As he was not using the teacher skill, his movements could not be easily detected, visually.<br />
There was only the thumping sound of the ground, and.<br />
Kwang! The rise of the fire wall when the fire spear penetrated the ground was what was only visible.<br />
In no time, Yoohyun who was next to me disappeared.<br />
I took out the cell phone as I felt the heat coming from the fire that was all around me.<br />
Truly, I really do not want to engage.<br />
After a few rings, Sung Hyunjae answered the phone.<br />
His normal calm voice reached my ears in somewhat different fashion.<br />
I felt timid, just by talking on the phone, shit, should I just say that I dialed the wrong number.  </p>
<p>…If you have some time now, could you please come to the Dungeon Brake Territory.<br />
You don’t have to if you are too busy though.<br />
[Is the leader Song, alone, not enough? He would be able to easily take care of Lycan type, even if it was an S-level monster.<br />
I also heard that Noah who is an auxiliary type was there, too.<br />
The only things that came into my view were the fires and intermittently rising debris.<br />
At the moment, I felt that it would be impossible to process the information that was to be transmitted through a skill, but I thought that that wouldn’t be a bad thing.<br />
Wouldn’t it be better to be unconscious than to face Sung Hyunjae, clear minded with only a C-level fear resistance.<br />
com If I was to pretend to be dead, Song Taewon might just brush by me.<br />
He is not a bear.<br />
Did they say that one would be devoured and eaten by the bear if one was to play dead.<br />
‘There is nothing else I can do anyway.<br />
’ I should just get a hold of myself before Sung Hyunjae was to arrive.<br />
First, I used the teacher skill towards Yoohyun, Iryn.<br />
Simultaneously, I felt heat rising in my body.<br />
It was almost like my mouth was drying up.<br />
With the L-level fear resistance, it would be like watching something burning from across the river, but right now, I felt like I was watching a great big fire of annihilation right before my eyes.<br />
And Song Taewon.<br />
‘…That was scary.<br />
’ Even if he was engulfed in fire, his eyes appeared ever colder.<br />
As the effectiveness of the skill has disappeared by two folds, the range of pillaging has been narrowed.<br />
Yet, as if he was equipped with fire resistance items, not much of injuries due to burning, even within the flaming fire, could be seen.<br />
But it wasn’t like there wasn’t any.<br />
One of his shoulders had a deep spiked wound, perhaps, from the direct impact of the fire spear.<br />
Kwwadduck, the foot that pounded the ground kicked off a piece of the asphalt in to the air.<br />
The flame that was going to burn Song Taewon has melted down the black mass.<br />
com Through it all, an edge of the hand engulfed with the black shadow split Han Yoohyun’s chest.<br />
As it wasn’t real flesh, no blood spewed out.<br />
There probably was no pain, either.<br />
It could be said that Yoohyun’s very body was, itself, a skill.<br />
Split widely, the fire did not easily recover its form, and being in a plight, he cringed his red eye brows.<br />
‘At this rate, I wouldn’t last ten minutes, let alone thirty minutes.<br />
’ On top of not having the original body, there wasn’t any equipment, nor could skills be used effectively.<br />
As a result, only the simple fire power was being used, causing greater loss of stamina.<br />
On top of that, Song Taewon’s skill was scraping off small bits at a time.<br />
Well, if nothing works, I will just faint.<br />
I again used the teacher skill against Song Taewon.<br />
My vision became blurry.<br />
I was breathing a bit faster, but it wasn’t to the point of losing my consciousness.<br />
‘Song Taewon, you do not reject it, though.<br />
’ Why.<br />
Although I felt curious, I still unilaterally transmitted Song Taewon’s senses to Yoohyun.<br />
Immediately after that, Yoohyun barely dodged Song Taewon’s kicks, and powerfully swung his arm.<br />
Like iron mace, the fire chunks pounded on Song Taewon.<br />
Being on the direct receiving end of it, he flew back and did a somersault in the air.<br />
Song Taewon threw a powerful kick to the external wall of the ill fated building.<br />
com The wall cracked and a great big hole was punctured in it.<br />
In the midst of the fluttering concrete dust, flame of fire rose up and the heat sensor has activated the sprinklers.<br />
Water and fire coming together caused strong rise of vapor.<br />
The two men collided once again in the midst of it.<br />
That building, it looks like it will collapse today.<br />
As the powers of the two men shook the area, I just plopped down as I felt nauseated like being sea sick.<br />
I wanted to lose my consciousness before Sung Hyunjae’s arrival, but I suppose I was tougher than I expected.<br />
I should really play dead- – Hyung! Yoonhyun shouted right then.<br />
I, too, felt an ominous feeling.<br />
Damn it.<br />
Kwaaaang.<br />
The earth shook.<br />
Shit.<br />
Before I was able to get up, something resembling a gigantic mole appeared out of the ground by crushing the sidewalk blocks into pieces.<br />
The monsters must have appeared, whether it was the 1st storey or the 2nd storey.<br />
I had briefly forgotten that I was the monster’s gastro-venture.<br />
com The mole screamed that it looks delicious as it looked at me.<br />
Just before the bastard extended its front paw out towards me.<br />
Pang! A black fire, appearing to bend in order to engulf it, blew up the dark skull.<br />
It was followed by a flying dagger, piercing through the head of another bastard that appeared behind me.<br />
The mole with a big punctured head, which was falling towards my direction, was pulled to the side by the wire that coiled around it.<br />
Kwang I felt a little dumbfounded by the falling monster which has avoided me to the side.<br />
Gosh, leader Song, you just told me that you were going to crush me or destroy me or something, and you really did it.<br />
‘Though it sure sounds like you.<br />
’ – Hyung, are you all right? Yoohyun quickly came over to my side, and again engulfed the mole that was sprouting out.<br />
It’s not like I’ve seen the monsters only once or twice before, I was just a bit nervous.<br />
However, I didn’t think I could get up.<br />
Besides, the ground was still shaking….<br />
They would need to do a major repair project around here.  </p>
<p>Since they are underground type, Noah Hunter must be having a difficult time stopping them without poison.<br />
com He said with some sense of surprise.<br />
You know it well.<br />
The S-level Lycanthrope has become a mess.  </p>
<p>That leader Song is the problem.<br />
As long as I was higher than an F-level, I was told that my life wasn’t supposed to be threatened, but Sung Hyunjae was wrong this time.<br />
[My item must have been very attractive.  </p>
<p>If you don’t want to see only the remnants of the item’s debris then you should jump over here within 10 minutes.<br />
I didn’t think that Song Taewon was really going to kill me, though.<br />
Wouldn’t he just break my arms and legs, so that I remain still and calm.<br />
Perhaps, it was because the degradation of the fear resistance, I felt one of my legs beginning to throb, just from thinking about it.<br />
I like both of my legs intact, so if you could please take it easy.<br />
‘Should I use teacher skill or something.<br />
’ Song Taewon said as he squeezed and crushed the neck of the mole.<br />
In no time, there only remained a long line of burn marks from the forehead to the right eye.<br />
Even a random person would feel the pain from just looking at it, yet he did not even blink.  </p>
<p>Han Yoojin.<br />
com The vein bulged hand pulled out the spine, and he threw it against another mole where it got lodged in the mole’s eye.<br />
Simultaneously, a the mole’s scream came as Taewon’s leg spiked down on the mole.<br />
Yoohyun leered at him who was approaching me.<br />
Although he had a ferocious attitude, the spirit fire has already been weakened for the most part.  </p>
<p>This way.<br />
I’ll protect you.<br />
A hand, covered with blood and torn flesh, extended out to me.<br />
He appeared to have gone mad from the fact that those words seemed sincere.<br />
Yoohyun cringed by holding me halfway.<br />
– Really, did something happen, hyung.<br />
The leader Song appeared to have tried to remove the wrist band, and you now say that you will protect me?.<br />
…Did we ever discuss anything about life, before.<br />
I interjected even after my life has become a mess by telling him to stop trying to do a twisted break dancing and just help my cause.<br />
Come to think of it, I should just let it go by admitting that Song Taewon had the right to pull out my tongue at least once, for change.<br />
Still, there was a nice vibe during our first meeting, Song Taewon’s car was demolished and my neck was squeezed….<br />
Hm, perhaps, not that much difference from today.<br />
Certainly, a person should have at least a small spoonful of fear in their hearts.<br />
Otherwise, this type of things could happen.<br />
I’m sorry, but I don’t want to go now because I am in fear of Song Taewon.<br />
Normally, I get scared at moments like this too.<br />
However, I reckon that it will be better than being eaten by the monsters.<br />
Song Taewon tried to coax me as if he has found me in the middle of a disaster.  </p>
<p>How would I know which would be better.<br />
It’s possible that the monster’s stomach could be more comforting than being captured by you.<br />
If you’d just follow my instructions quietly, nothing will happen.<br />
What I have said came back to me.<br />
All the while, the moles kept coming out of the ground.<br />
They formed a pack at a distance away from the fire.<br />
– …I’ll come out as quickly as I can.<br />
Having become quite blurry, Yoohyun looked down on me with a concern.  </p>
<p>No need to.<br />
It’s fine.<br />
com Yoohyun’s body size shrunk.<br />
Having returned to the shape of Iryn, the lizard, he absorbed into my shoulder like a tattoo.<br />
Song Taewon came towards me by walking on the messed up road.<br />
Not even having the strength to stand up, I looked up at the man that stood before me.<br />
I felt chilly, although it was a summer night.<br />
To say it honestly, I shuddered.  </p>
<p>I’m a scared ordinary person.<br />
Please be kind to me.<br />
I’ll certainly do that if you choose to remain that way.<br />
You mean drink beers together, make small talks over the phone, and things like that.<br />
Not during business hours.<br />
Do you normally stay friendly with your neighbors like that.<br />
I’m not a person who others can easily be friendly towards.<br />
I, too, won’t be able to remain friendly should I feel fear.<br />
com for the best novel reading experience Song Taewon lowered his back.<br />
He then lightly picked me up.  </p>
<p>So, you are not going to call me anymore.<br />
I am.<br />
And I will continue to do the things that you do not like.<br />
No matter what, you will continue to do the same anyway even if I wouldn’t like it.<br />
However, since I’m close to an S-level, please go soft on me.<br />
Tang- A piece of the sidewalk block was kicked in the place of a reply.<br />
The head of the mole that was slowly approaching has been demolished.<br />
Those bastards were the kind that could easily breach the blockades and cause wreak havoc in the city.<br />
However, they were all just looking at me.<br />
At this rate, the essential option to minimize the dungeon brake damage would get added.  </p>
<p>I’m not sure how to talk to Han Yoojin still.<br />
I reckon that it may be better to get rid of him right here, right now.<br />
His calm voice gave me more goose bumps.<br />
As I tried to choose the words in the midst of ever so rising fear.<br />
com Kwaang-! There was a sound of thunder.<br />
There came a light that was bright enough to hurt my eyes as the pack of the moles was swept away.<br />
The monstrous screams of the bastards were continually being absorbed by the thunder.<br />
It was truly in an instant that the pack of the monsters changed into a pile of dead bodies.<br />
As a bonus, along with them, a villa and two buildings were unfortunately blown up like that of a popcorn packaging.  </p>
<p>Leader Song.<br />
Sung Hyunjae easily jumped over the road that has been cracked open as if there had been an earthquake.<br />
There was a smile in the eyes that were focused in this direction.  </p>
<p>You should return the lost items that you find to the rightful owner.<br />
Can a government worker claim an award for returning lost and found items? My item is very precious and expensive.<br />
You can really make a big score.<br />
Sung Hyunjae spoke in a way to hurt one’s feeling, as he always did.<br />
At this moment, I thought that Song Taewon and I were having a similar feeling.  </p>

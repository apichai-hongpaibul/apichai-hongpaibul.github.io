In short, that you’re not normal.<br />
But don’t worry.<br />
Truthfully, it’s two peas in a pod[1 so it’s nothing new.<br />
[…Huh? Hm? Yoohyun’s voice was full of confusion.<br />
Moon Hyuna’s eyes became round, too.<br />
Seeing that, the tips of my mouth quirked up.<br />
You know how to talk behind someone’s back – I know how to too.<br />
Wait, since it was in front of the person involved, was it in front of their face?.<br />
Should I tell you an old story? It’s something from 1 year ago.<br />
Specifically, the spring 1 year ago.<br />
April 2nd.<br />
Around 5 pm in Gyeonggi-do Icheon’s[2 CS convenience store-.<br />
Han Yoojin-ssi!Moon Hyuna suddenly yelled as she snatched the cell phone away and turned it off.<br />
Her cheeks were slightly red.<br />
I-I mean, you wouldn’t, it’s probably not that….<br />
It seems like it is a story that the Breaker Guild Leader knows as well.<br />
There shouldn’t be that many people who know it….<br />
It isn’t that there is no one at all who know it.<br />
I heard it by accident.<br />
I will keep secret who I heard it from.<br />
The embarrassing and crazy thing that Moon Hyuna wanted to hide was used as a card to make her lose face 4 years later.<br />
At that time, it was a secret that everyone got to know, but this time it wasn’t.<br />
It really was an anecdote that you couldn’t forget and left a deep impression.  </p>
<p>…Fuck and I can’t kill to block your mouth either.<br />
The eyes that flashed towards me[3 were murderous.<br />
But she couldn’t raise a hand against me.<br />
She had already stamped the contract.<br />
Unless she was going to fight 5:1 including the Association, she could only hold it back.<br />
com And from the position of needing familiars the most, she would feel regretful laying a hand on me simply over something like this.<br />
Without me, you could only get high rank familiars after 2 years.  </p>
<p>So why did you talk about my brother behind his back? You reap what you sow; if you talk behind someone’s back, others will talk behind your back.<br />
When I scrunched my eyes and smiled, even her teeth grinded as if she was angry.<br />
Just then, Yoohyun must have called again because the cell phone rang.<br />
Moon Hyuna’s eyes darted up and down.  </p>
<p>You are not going to pick it up.<br />
……You’ll shut your mouth, right.<br />
It is my loss, but I don’t want to listen to slander about by brother, so let us both keep our mouths shut.<br />
Fine.<br />
I picked up the phone and passed over it by speaking vaguely.<br />
Moon Hyuna’s expression taking back the phone was as if she was chewing poop.<br />
You are formidable, Han Yoojin-ssi.<br />
I didn’t even dream that that story would come up.<br />
I can trust you, right.<br />
Of course.<br />
If it comes out, I’ll be very embarrassed and lose face and want to hide for about half a year, but it’ll be just that.<br />
But I’ll definitely kill the bastard who opened his mouth.<br />
Her voice was calm but I could definitely feel that it was full of sincerity.<br />
Especially at the part where she said she would kill.<br />
Did she mean there was a limit to what she could bear?.<br />
Please don’t worry.<br />
Moon Hyuna-ssi is my loving client.<br />
If you hide for half a year, it would be difficult for me too, so why would I do something like that.<br />
You speak well.<br />
There’s nothing else?Would there be nothing else? Appearances aside, I was an avid follower of Hunter related programs.<br />
There was quite a lot I knew, but if I carelessly loosened my tongue, of course things would become annoying, but also there would a lot of people who wouldn’t be able to hold back unlike the murderous S-Rank-nim in front of me, so I was keeping my mouth shut.<br />
If they didn’t touch me first, I would also be quiet.<br />
com for the best novel reading experience.<br />
If I say there isn’t, would you believe me.<br />
Ah right.<br />
You’re crazy guy 2’s hyung.<br />
I was wondering if you were naive unlike that guy, but that really was stupid.<br />
I’ll definitely remember.<br />
…Naive? Did I act in a way that made me look like that? The negotiations seemed like they ended well, though.  </p>
<p>……I must have seemed like someone to take lightly.<br />
At my words, Moon Hyuna snorted.  </p>
<p>Of course I took you lightly.<br />
Just think, wasn’t a little F, who had just Awakened and hadn’t even stopped seeming like an ordinary person yet, saying Han Yoohyun, that person, was gentle? It’s the same as advertising ‘I’m a noob who doesn’t know anything about the Hunter community’.<br />
Ah, well it could seem like that too.<br />
Officially, I was a novice who hasn’t been Awakened for even one month.<br />
In actuality, I had the most Hunter work experience out of all of the people who had gathered there, but who would even guess that.<br />
In the end, it would have seemed like a semi-ordinary person was saying ‘my younger brother is gentle’ with an ordinary person’s standards.<br />
Of course, past looking like someone to take lightly, they would have thought ‘wow an easygoing kid got a useful skill, should I try poking him~’.<br />
Like Moon Hyuna just a while ago.<br />
No wonder, they weren’t people who would be so, but they were weirdly friendly.<br />
A sigh came out automatically.  </p>
<p>They wouldn’t all act annoying like Moon Hyuna-ssi, right.<br />
Why ‘ssi’, making us feel distant; just call me noona.<br />
Moon Hyuna had regained her composure and she propped up her chin as she smiled brightly.<br />
‘Noona’, yeah right.<br />
My mental age was thirty.  </p>
<p>I’m impatient because of the familiars.<br />
Though the rest wouldn’t not approach either.<br />
Do well, that dongsaeng with that hyung-nim[4.<br />
It looked like I shouldn’t take even one step out of the guild building for a while.<br />
Moon Hyuna waved her hand.<br />
I felt the surrounding air tremble.<br />
Then the blocked off voices surged through.  </p>
<p>com Yerim ran over and slightly glared at Moon Hyuna.  </p>
<p>Did you not come here by promising to not touch him?Did she make that kind of promise.<br />
Then again, there was no way Yoohyun just gave an okay.  </p>
<p>Did I touch him? We just talked.<br />
Moon Hyuna said, lifting and showing both hands.<br />
She certainly didn’t lay a hand on me.  </p>
<p>Ah, unni, really.<br />
Oho, are you coming at me!Moon Hyuna shot up and abruptly pulled the fuming Yerim into her arms.  </p>
<p>com for the best novel reading experience.<br />
At your age, not putting any on is prettier~.<br />
Those two got along better than I had thought.<br />
What should I do if Yerim really went to Breaker after 3 years? That place would scatter in all directions in 4 years.<br />
Of course, there wasn’t a way for the future to be exactly the same.<br />
…Should I bring Moon Hyuna over instead? She was a woman I didn’t like, but it was a waste leaving a Hunter like her alone out of spite.<br />
‘And it wouldn’t be that hard applying the keyword either.<br />
’ We were of different genders but the S-Rank who would come looking for me the most from now on was exactly Moon Hyuna.<br />
She had an immense interest in familiars so the probability was high that she would keep coming to find me and check while I was raising the monsters.<br />
Even today, she purposely came to meet me.<br />
So I thought it would be possible to slowly apply the keyword through joking love ballads and sufficient friendliness.<br />
The problem was the keyword’s additional effect.<br />
com for the best novel reading experience ‘The probability of not having a person she thinks of as a caregiver would be low.<br />
’ Unlike Yoo Myeongwoo, who was left alone, Moon Hyuna was an athlete who had even entered world championships.<br />
She would’ve had the care of, of course her parents, but also managers or coach, special trainers, sunbaes, etc.<br />
I would be thankful if the person was related to sports, and dad was fine, and mom was, well… I could deal with hearing ‘mom’ from Moon Hyuna.<br />
It would probably feel joking from a woman older than me.<br />
If I got her trust from the keyword’s effect and nudged her enough when the problems within Breaker got bigger, I would be able to steal her away.<br />
‘I don’t want to be close to her, but it wouldn’t be bad to put her in Haeyeon.<br />
She was definitely competent and her general disposition fits well with Yerim.<br />
’ Current S-Rank dungeon attack teams were normally one S-Rank Hunter with the majority as A-Ranks, but later when the dungeon difficulty level increased, there were teams with two or more S-Ranks.<br />
Yoohyun’s and Yerim’s attributes were incompatible so they wouldn’t be able to work as a team but Yerim and Moon Hyuna would work together well.<br />
A powerful one-blow attack and a wide-range tool specialized in tying up opponents.<br />
On top of that, Yerim had a wide-range buff too.<br />
If they cooperated, they would become a really good combo.<br />
‘Imagining it, I feel pretty drawn to it.<br />
com That’s right, at any rate she would be Yerim’s partner, not mine.<br />
Let’s call it properly playing the role of guardian and try hard to reel her in.<br />
After deciding, seeing those two people playing was pleasing in its own way.<br />
Please get along well from now on as well.<br />
The shooting finished smoothly.<br />
There wasn’t anything difficult either.<br />
It was just trivial content where I explained about Peace, exchanged Q&amp;A, checked response time and pulling strength of his teeth from ball throwing, etc.<br />
They asked me to show a cherishing and loving attitude toward Peace, but that was really easy.<br />
Since our Peace was lovable originally.<br />
It was a relief that Peace was my brother’s familiar; if I had to send him far away, I would have been too lonely.<br />
I could probably keep him when he wasn’t doing dungeon attacks, right?.<br />
Ahjussi, you’re drinking mana potions again?After the shooting finished, I had put down Peace for a while and taken out a mana potion, when Yerim came towards me and asked.  </p>
<p>Should I give you one too? It’s orange flavor.<br />
com for a better experience.<br />
Only the smell is orange – there’s barely any sweetness and it’s tart.<br />
The apple flavor is bland and doesn’t taste good.<br />
It seemed okay to me.<br />
And you didn’t eat it for its taste.<br />
When I opened the bottle cap and drank it in one gulp, Yerim sent me a worried gaze.  </p>
<p>Just today, it was three bottles – is it okay to just drink that much? There’s no recommended dosage.<br />
What recommended dosage.<br />
It’s just to restore mental fatigue.<br />
Since I couldn’t say that my mana was low from using the Seed-Leaf skill.<br />
Even though I searched to death, I didn’t see any status windows worth picking up.<br />
Since there were so many people, I just flipped through the letters[5, but whether it was skills or stats, the best were C-Rank.<br />
‘The camera director could probably get what I’m seeing as a C-Rank special skill, but…’ The keyword application was one thing, but the optimization that I could only use once per month was too precious.<br />
I didn’t know when or where an A-Rank might pop up so I had to save it as much as possible.<br />
com Why were the Awakening Centers specialized for combat? Of course, there was no need to be dissatisfied with aptitude Awakening.<br />
Should I make a private Awakening Center instead? Since I could see the optimized initial skills, the conditions fitting each person… hm… that was also too troublesome.  </p>
<p>Ahjussi! Why are are you blanking out again!Yerim yelled, jumping up.  </p>
<p>Saying it’s for recovering mental fatigue, even after you drink it you blank out.<br />
You’re not hurt anywhere? Always being tired, that, I heard it could be a serious illness…She was taken aback from what she herself said and even her complexion became pale.<br />
What serious illness.<br />
I was healthy even up to 5 years later.  </p>
<p>I was just thinking of something else for a bit.<br />
Peace, come here.<br />
But ahjussi is stat F! Shouldn’t you go for a health checkup? When was the last time you had one?I mean, even though F-Ranks were weak, they were just ordinary people.<br />
Though compared to S-Ranks, they were a piece of paper.  </p>
<p>I don’t remember but I’m fine.<br />
Guild Leader.<br />
A general checkup, to make you get-.<br />
Don’t! I’m really fine!I didn’t want to go to a hospital! On top of that, if it was a general checkup, then I would have to get an endoscopy, so what would I do if I[6 said nonsense.<br />
You could do it awake instead of asleep, but that was hard.  </p>
<p>Kim Sunghan ahjussi also worries about ahjussi over anything; please take good care of your body.<br />
Yerim complained, putting her cell phone back at my dissuasion.<br />
I mean, that was because that person thought of me as a seventy-year-old elder.  </p>
<p>Excuse me, can I take a picture with you?Just then, two pretty girls who looked like celebrities came towards us and asked.<br />
Both were FF.  </p>
<p>Yes, you can.<br />
Just in case, you cannot.<br />
No matter how good and well-behaved Peace was, a monster was a monster.<br />
Even the broadcast shooting was possible because they got special approval from the Association and Hunters including Yerim and Moon Hyuna accompanied me; I couldn’t take him outside by myself.<br />
It was still illegal.<br />
Though it seemed like the law related to tamed monster accompaniment would change faster than it originally did, thanks to Peace.  </p>
<p>Can I also take a picture?Seeing the two girls take a picture, another person came over.<br />
Then the number of people nearby started to increase one by one.<br />
These people wanted to take pictures but just gazed at us.<br />
I wouldn’t be coming here again so I should just let them.  </p>
<p>Peace is really cute.<br />
Are you on any social media?Social media, should I try it? I did have a few pictures and videos I took of Peace.<br />
Especially the pictures before growth were too good for only me to look at.<br />
He was cute now, but he was even cuter when he was small.<br />
I am not yet, but I will think about it.<br />
Please definitely make one!Yes, yes.<br />
I definitely thought I should spread my kid’s cuteness far and wide.<br />
Just then, people were talking noisily near the back of the crowd, when a man walked through as a space was formed.<br />
At the same time, of course mine and Yerim’s, but also the nearby people’s gazes were drawn to him.<br />
Wow, really….<br />
Freaking good-looking.<br />
…Yerim.<br />
Please talk nicely.<br />
But he really was freaking good-looking.<br />
Advertisements And the possible Awakening stats were B, and skills were A.<br />
com for the best novel reading experience Possible Awakening stat rank B Optimized Initial Skills Can’t Take Eyes Off(A) Become Comfortable When Looking At(A) The Icing On The Cake[7(A) The skills were triple A.<br />
And all of them had names that seemed like special skills.<br />
Not to mention… they seemed to be related to his appearance.<br />
Was it because your face was also an aptitude? If you had that kind of face, even if you Awakened with S-Rank stats, nothing might change.<br />
Stat compensation wasn’t ‘you become good-looking’, but setting a balance, so there was a limit.<br />
If your facial features were already perfect, it couldn’t add anything.  </p>
<p>Excuse me, could you give me your autograph!Bak Hayool blushed and said to Yerim.<br />
He was most likely a celebrity but his position was switched.<br />
com for the best novel reading experience.<br />
…An autograph.<br />
Yes! I really admire and like Hunters! This is my first time actually meeting an S-Rank Hunter, so when you were going to the Association to set your rank, I really wanted to go and see, but I could not, because of my schedule.<br />
But then I heard that you were shooting here so I came over really quickly!Bak Hayool couldn’t hide his excitement and politely held out the autograph paper.<br />
There were kids like that occasionally.<br />
People who fantasized about Hunters and acted like fans chasing after celebrities.<br />
Especially since S-Ranks had amazing looks, as time went by, the fan base became bigger.<br />
But it was ironic since a guy even better looking than an S-Rank was acting that way.<br />
On top of that, if he just Awakened, he would be B-Rank at minimum.<br />
‘Though optimized Awakening would probably be impossible.<br />
’ Through the Awakening Center, he definitely wouldn’t get those skills.<br />
It seemed very likely he would become an half, with only the stat being B and the skills failing.<br />
Even so, for me to reel him in was kind of a little… ambiguous.<br />
And I didn’t want to say the keyword to that face even if I died.<br />
He was a celebrity with a good face so he would probably live well on his own.<br />
I should stop paying attention.<br />
Advertisements.<br />
I am in the middle of shooting a movie.<br />
com for the best novel reading experience.<br />
Uh, yes.<br />
Please do.<br />
You can send it to Haeyeon Guild.<br />
Thank you!It seemed like a serious illness.<br />
But, a movie shoot, he said.<br />
Unconsciously, I tilted my head.<br />
I didn’t remember seeing such a good-looking actor.<br />
The me these days was far from a cultured life, so it was possible I didn’t see movies that were filmed now, but still, if it was that face, he would have kept on appearing in various mediums after this.<br />
And it wasn’t a face that was easy to forget.<br />
But why wasn’t he in my memories? Did he retire early?.<br />
Han Yoojin-nim!Bak Hayool, who had gotten Yerim’s autograph, now looked at me with an uncomfortable glint in his eyes.  </p>
<p>I would like to ask for your autograph! Could I possibly get Peace’s footprint.<br />
…Only the autograph is possible.<br />
I quickly signed and sent him away.<br />
Since he was someone I wouldn’t meet again.<br />

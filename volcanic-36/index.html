<p>Most of the territory of Chongqing was formed by low hills made by limestones and sandstones, except for the Central Region which was connected by the Yangtze River.
There was a region called the Secret Burial Grounds in the west. It was a place that especially had a lot of rocks like limestones and sandstones. Ju Seo Cheon’s group entered the Secret Burial Grounds. “What did you say was here?”
Wang il asked. It was impossible to farm or cut wood near the Secret Burial. There were only rocks in that place but that didn’t mean there were mines with steel ores in it. The only things were the rocks that were spread on the low hills. You couldn’t even find plants so it was no different from being a land of death. The last time they had rested was three days ago, in a nearby village. The group was as exhausted as they could be. Ju Seo Cheon entered a deep place inside the Secret Burial Grounds that showed no signs of humans having been there. “The treasure trove.” A thick smile formed in Ju Seo Cheon’s face. His shining eyes were looking at the rocks that were stuck together. “Huh…?” Zhuge Seung Kye raised his head and checked the rocks. His eyes were filled with suspicions. “This is….” “Oh, brother. Do you know what it is?” Ju Seo Cheon rejoiced and asked. “No, I can’t explain it in words but…mm, right. Let’s see. This place seems a bit weird.”
Zhuge Seung Kye stepped out actively. That wasn’t like him. He touched a part of the boulder. His eyes shone in an investigative light. “Do what you want.”
Ju Seo Cheon sat on a random rock. It didn’t seem like he would stand up anytime soon looking at the way he had sat down. ‘Whew, he’s not the best genius regarding the Arts of Machinery. We wouldn’t have been able to find even the entrance if I hadn’t taken Seung Kye with us.’ He had wandered a bit but he was unable to find the location of the treasury successfully with just the help of his memories.
But when he arrived at this place, he noticed that there was something different from his memories. It was the existence of an entrance.
In his past life, the entrance had already been opened because it was discovered beforehand but there was nothing today.
He was honestly so flustered that no words came out from his mouth. Click. “Uh, this is it.”
Something made a sound while he was in the middle of touching the rocks. Kugugugung! After that, a loud sound was heard and the ground shook. At first, they got the impression that the sky was collapsing. “Wh, what is it!”
The warriors were astonished. Even Wang il, who could be called a seasoned veteran, showed bewilderment. “Ho, was that the case? So they made it like this. Impressive indeed.” The surroundings shook at the tremor. Zhuge Seung Kye lost his balance and fell on the ground but it didn’t seem like he was scared.
Contrary to that, he checked his surroundings with curious eyes and mumbled. He was usually a scaredy cat but showed this personality on things related to the Arts of Machinery. ‘Finally!’ How long had he waited for this moment! After he returned in time, he thought about the treasury and set up a plan. He prepared several times, thought and modified his plans.
And that hard work finally paid off.
He understood how explorers felt after he became the first discoverer that would be recorded down in history for this important event. “I’m sorry.” Originally, there was another owner for this view.
And Ju Seo Cheon apologized to that unknown person. “Umm.” Wang il exclaimed.
After about ten minutes passed, and the stairs that connected underground appeared in front of the group. “Just what…”
Wang il mumbled. “We arrived at our destination.”
Ju Seo Cheon lifted Zhuge Seung Kye, who was still on the floor and mumbling,
“A, a tomb with a mechanism like this installed…just who is asleep in here?” “Treasures.” Ju Seo Cheon’s eyes curved like a crescent moon.
Fwoosh.
Torches lit up. What appeared before them when they descended the stairs was a room that could accommodate a hundred people.
There was a writing with three eyes written on the floor. “Don’t tell me…” Wang il saw the writing and thought of something. No, it wasn’t only him. All the other warriors thought the same thing. “This is a writing of the Three Eyed Immoral God!” Zhuge Seung Kye was the first one who yelled in a surprised voice.
The Three Eyed Immoral God was such an outstanding legendary thief that there was no one that didn’t know about him. It was the same for five or six year old kids. “No, that is impossible.” There was a guess in his head but it was too unreliable so he shook his head immediately and denied it. “Hey, captain.” It was a thick voice that didn’t belong to a man, but to a woman.
She was the only female among the ten warriors.
However, her physique was bigger than the average men and her well trained and swelled muscles boasted of a perfect beauty.
There was a long vertical scar on her mouth and her eyes were quite sharp.
You couldn’t say that she was the pretty type, and in the first place she was a middle aged woman that couldn’t be seen as a love partner. “What’s wrong Cho Ryeon?”
Ju Seo Cheon replied while checking his surroundings thoroughly.
“Speak honestly. Whose tomb is this?”
Cho Ryeon’s face was really stiff.
“According to my information, this isn’t a tomb but a treasury.”
At least, the corpse of the Three Eyed Immoral God wasn’t discovered in his past life. “So, whose?”
Cho Ryeon asked as if it was frustrating. “The Three Eyed Immoral God” Ju Seo Cheon answered without hesitating at all. “Impossible!” Zhuge Seung Kye jumped up. “Th, this place is the treasury of that legendary thief? That was only a baseless rumor!”
No one knew what happened after the The Three Eyed Immoral God died. That’s why people spoke more about the treasures he left behind. There was no way the treasures stolen by a thief that represented almost an entire era, disappeared. They thought that those treasures would certainly be hidden somewhere.
And there was also an investigation by the government. But in the end, only the rumors became denser and the treasures didn’t get discovered.
The government, Murim and even tomb raiders stepped forward but they couldn’t find a single clue. That was how the treasury was forgotten over time. “We will know that when we enter.”
Ju Seo Cheon said while still looking in front. There were a total of eight passages spreading like roots from the center of the room. They all looked identical to each other so you couldn’t differentiate them. On top of that, the passages were pitch black so you couldn’t see what was in it. “Someone wants to return?” Ju Seo Cheon turned back and asked the opinion of the group but no one answered.
They all came here due to their own private circumstances. “I don’t know if it’s real but… I don’t think we will be able to turn around after we advance, what should we do?” Cho Ryeon asked Wang il.
It meant that she was that uneasy. “What do you mean…we have to follow Captain even if it means our death.”
“I will work hard so that you don’t die but I promise you that I will take responsibility for your families even if that does happen.” Ju Seo Cheon added some words right after Wang il. “Whew.”
Someone sighed in relief at those words.
It seemed like they couldn’t do anything about it. “Just give the order, Captain.”
“I will take the lead, and you protect Seung from all sides. However, don’t block his view. Even if he looks like this, he is the most important one among us.” Seung was the fake name Zhuge Seung Kye would be using temporarily. “How so?”
“This treasury itself has so many mechanisms it could be seen as a single mechanism. The only one that can recognize it and disarm it is the person standing there.”
“This kid?” Cho Ryeon looked down at Zhuge Seung Kye with a suspicious look. “Ahem.” Zhuge Seung Kye spread his chest and acted pridefully.
He had a negative way of thinking about every circumstance but he showed quite the confident look about things related to the Arts of Machinery. “It doesn’t matter if you don’t believe me but you can do that if you want to see everyone in here die after leaving him behind.”
“…Tch.”
Cho Ryeon clicked her tongue. “In addition, I said that I would be taking the lead but we will prioritize Seung’s words rather than mine. You should follow what he says even if our opinions differ. At least, he’s more of an expert than the people gathered here.” “I don’t feel that relieved when thinking that all of our lives rely on a kid that isn’t even ten yet.”
Wang il sighed. The group made the final inspection before entering the passageways. “Which path should we take?”
Ju Seo Cheon asked Zhuge Seung Kye. “Um, it doesn’t seem that different?”
Zhuge Seung Kye scratched his head. “Right, then…let’s go over there.”
He walked towards the third passageway from the left.
“Ah, wait.”
Zhuge Seung Kye stopped Ju Seo Cheon. When Ju Seo Cheon asked what was wrong, Zhuge Seung Kye picked a pebble that was on the floor and threw it towards the entrance. Chechechecheng! The moment the pebble passed the entrance, spears fell down from the ceiling and stabbed the ground. “…You said that there was no difference?”
Ju Seo Cheon asked in a dumbfounded way. “Right. All of them have that installed.”
Zhuge Seung Kye blinked as if asking what was the problem. “I’m going crazy.”
Wang il gulped saliva. His complexion was plae. “After that…there’s nothing else, right?”
“Yes.”
“Haa. We should take care of those spears first.” The group pulled out the spears blocking the entrance. There were about a hundred spears.
They were able to enter the passageway after that. “How did Young Master Seung notice that? If possible, can you teach me how you did it?”
Wang il asked Zhuge Seung Kye politely. “It’s pointless to ask him.” Ju Seo Cheon smirked and laughed out loud. “Ah, I made a mistake.”
Wang il thought that the Arts of Machinery was a kind of martial arts for Zhuge Seung Kye. He quickly apologized as he thought that he was asking something like the secrets of a martial art. “No, that’s not what I meant.”
Ju Seo Cheon shook his head lightly. “Hey Seung, can you teach us how you did it?”
Ju Seo Cheon stopped for a moment and looked at Zhuge Seung Kye. “Why can’t you see something this easy to notice?”
Zhuge Seung Kye tilted his head as if he couldn’t understand. “Um…it’s hard to explain, you can just see it right. Like saying that there will be a trap installed over there.”
The warriors and Wang il included fell in silence. “What a kid. He’s full of himself.”
Cho Ryeon mumbled. “I agree.”
Ju Seo Cheon also agreed. There was a time that he had asked some simple things to Zhuge Seung Kye to learn about them.
But Zhuge Seung Kye always tilted his head and spoke strange words like now.
Borrowing Zhuge Seung Kye’s words, you just had to touch the part that seemed awkward to disarm it.
He was really a genius, and the type he hated the most. “But he’s that reliable.” There were dozens of types of traps installed in the passageway.
Not even an hour had passed, but the number of traps that got activated or that they disarmed was so much they had to give up on counting it.
They would have died already if it wasn’t for him.
The group members that were half in doubt at Ju Seo Cheon’s words realized the importance of Zhuge Seung Kye and got serious on guarding him.
And after another hour passed.
The passageway started to widen and dolls appeared. But there weren’t one or two of them.
The group raised their torches to check what it was and said something strance. “Wooden dolls?” </p>

    <h1 id="the-s-classes-that-i-raised-3">The S-Classes That I Raised-3.</h1>
<p>I was sitting on a bed and not on a dragon’s body.<br />
The scent of blood was also gone.<br />
The clothes I had been wearing were different too.<br />
‘……Have I really gone back in time?’ First of all, I could not open the status window.<br />
I didn’t have my inventory either.<br />
Five years ago, I still had yet to be Awakened.<br />
‘Yuhyun, that kid, was already a popular guild leader.<br />
’ Haeyeon Guild (垓埏).<br />
It was the guild that would become the best in both Korea and the world after five years of rapid development with a small number of elite members.<br />
Of course, I was unable to get in.<br />
…There were many guild members that did not like me.<br />
‘I’ve heard a hundred times that I should stop hanging around the guild and get out.<br />
’ Ugh, lousy things.<br />
Yeah, this time around I’ll keep my head down and live well.<br />
I rummaged through my pocket and took out my cellphone.<br />
The date… Oh, I really was 5 years in the past.<br />
com Just that morning I had contacted the Awakening Broker.<br />
Seeing that, I began to recall the past.<br />
‘I have gone back to that time.<br />
’ It had been 3 years since Dungeons started appearing in the world, causing the Awakening of many enthusiastic Hunters.<br />
Now was a time where the rapidly changing world was gradually stabilizing.<br />
It was a time when I was struggling with an inferiority complex, only able to look at the back of my brother, who was a well-known.<br />
S-level Awakening”.<br />
Therefore I contacted the Awakening Broker in the vain hope that if I Awakened, I would be like him.<br />
Awakening Brokers.<br />
To put it simply, swindlers.<br />
Awakening Brokers were brokers who illegally allowed people to enter Dungeons in exchange for a large amount of money, telling them that they would Awaken if they clear the Dungeon.<br />
Most of them, however, were vicious people who would disappear after taking the money.<br />
Even if they did take you to the Dungeon, they would not protect you.<br />
‘It’s not like I Awakened through clearing a Dungeon in the first place.<br />
’ There was a high possibility of Awakening due to the dangerous environment of a Dungeon, but it has nothing to do with clearing the Dungeon.<br />
Those facts were revealed to the public half a year later and the Korean Hunter’s Association would later create a safe Awakening facility, and brokers completely disappeared.<br />
Anyway, I had packed some money to meet with the broker.<br />
com for the best novel reading experience ‘I had gotten caught by my younger brother’s men and brought here.<br />
’ Yeah, I remember this for sure.<br />
This was one of the rooms in the Haeyeon Guild building.<br />
Right now he was probably going to come in and yell at me with disapproval.<br />
Just as I had that thought, the door burst open.<br />
Han Yuhyun stepped into the room.<br />
He wasn’t a gentleman either.  </p>
<p>Hyung.<br />
My living younger brother called out to me.<br />
The face looking at me was very young.<br />
He was young even after five years but right now, he was even younger.<br />
He was twenty years old, now.<br />
He was just now showing signs of being an adult; if the world was peaceful, he would still be a student.<br />
Either that or he would have just been enlisted into the army.<br />
Of course, the army still existed.<br />
‘S Class Awakeners were exempt from the army, though.<br />
com for a better experience I had gone there.<br />
There were many young man in the army who Awakened in the army and get discharged early.<br />
If I had been honorably discharged, it would be due to the fact that I was an F Class.<br />
Exemption from military service started with Class Es.<br />
Anyway Yuhyun was so good that he didn’t need to go to the military… Oh, my inferiority complex was about to explode again.<br />
Let’s give up greed.<br />
Let’s throw away anguish.<br />
Namo Amitahba.<br />
(tn: Buddhist mantra) With a dirty look on his face, Yuhyun walked towards me.<br />
Now that he was closer, I could see that the five-year period was more difficult for him than I had thought.<br />
I hadn’t really thought about it before my regression, but now it seemed that he must have had a hard time.<br />
It wasn’t easy to make and develop your own guild even if you were an S Class.<br />
Meanwhile, his older brother got into an accident.<br />
……I was wrong.  </p>
<p>Dungeon Brokers are.<br />
I’m sorry.<br />
com I apologized first.<br />
My younger brother, who was about to lecture me, shut up.<br />
He looked at me as if he had never seen me before.  </p>
<p>I won’t do it again.<br />
For this and everything that would have happened later.<br />
I would live up to my word.<br />
Yuhyun had a confused look on his face and carefully opened his mouth.  </p>
<p>By any chance, if you’ve had any major accident….<br />
It’s not like that.<br />
He didn’t trust me.<br />
He didn’t believe me.<br />
I slapped him on the arm with a smile.  </p>
<p>Well, I sat down and thought about it, and I realized that I seem to have been immature.<br />
com The dragon’s back was cool, so it had been the perfect placed for me to rest my head.<br />
My little brother was taken aback by my awkward remarks.  </p>
<p>No, it’s not that you’re immature… no.<br />
Not really.<br />
Hey, can I give you a hug.<br />
H, huh.<br />
It’s been a long time.<br />
It’s been a long time for him, but not me.<br />
The cold sensation of his body was still clear under the palm of my hand.  </p>
<p>……as you please.<br />
Yuhyun hesitantly nodded.<br />
Your big brother is just going to hug you once, little brother.<br />
com Well, I’m a little embarrassed too.<br />
I stretched out my arms and hugged my brother.<br />
The hug covered his entire body.<br />
It was smaller than before I had regressed.  </p>
<p>My younger brother, Han Yuhyun.<br />
His body was warm in my arms.<br />
I could hear the slightly accelerated beating of his heat and breath.<br />
In my deep relief, something came out of my mouth.<br />
It was something that I usually never would have said.  </p>
<p>I love you.<br />
His body flinched and trembled.<br />
Hey, I’m embarrassed too, so don’t say anything.<br />
Just— [The Awakening of ‘Han Yujin’ has been registered.<br />
com [Legendary Title ‘Perfect Caregiver’ granted! What? [Title ‘Perfect Caregiver’ is in effect.<br />
Perfect Caregiver Additional Skills – My Little One’s The Best The growth rate of the Awakened ‘Han Yuhyun’ is doubled.<br />
Duration – 3 days Whaaat?!? The hell, what was this scam skill? Caregiver titles were common.<br />
It was easy to receive this title if you were a parent or an older sibling who took care of and raised an Awakened person.<br />
It was even possible without blood relations.<br />
com If the dependent’s Awakening Class was over C and the relationship was good, it was likely for this title to appear.<br />
If the dependent’s Awakening was C Class to B Class, the title would be ‘Clumsy Caregiver’.<br />
A Class was ‘Ordinary Caregiver’.<br />
Finally, S Class was just ‘Caregiver’.<br />
I had thought that the title of ‘Caregiver’ was considered to be the highest as there were no Awakeners that were beyond S Class.<br />
‘The Perfect Caregiver? What the hell is this?’ In addition, the rate of the growth buffs was doubled.<br />
My former title, ‘Caregiver’, gave an additional growth buff of up to 10 percent.<br />
It only lasted for a single day.<br />
But this was double that.<br />
Didn’t this mean that you could raise a level in half a year? ‘No, the benefits are more towards skills than levels.<br />
Higher grade skills grow at a frustratingly slower pace!’ Wow, this was totally a scam.<br />
If I gave someone a buff before they went into a Dungeon, they would grow at light speed.  </p>
<p>…hyung.<br />
Uh, yeah.<br />
No.<br />
com I was so surprised that I had kept hugging him.<br />
As I relaxed my arms and stepped back, Yuhyun’s face turned a little red and he coughed.  </p>
<p>……Lately I’ve been putting a lot of pressure on you.<br />
Thanks for saying this, hyung.<br />
Th, thank you.<br />
….<br />
……An awkward silence fell.<br />
Well.<br />
Hmm, hmm.<br />
When I felt that I could no longer bear the awkwardness and wanted to break and jump out of a window, Yuhyun spoke.  </p>
<p>……Do you want to have dinner with me later? It has been a long time.<br />
Oh, I’d love to.<br />
Yes.<br />
Well, I’ve got work to do.<br />
Mm, keep up the good work.<br />
My brother went out and the door closed.<br />
I tore my hair out.<br />
‘Wow, that was awkward.<br />
’ Was this what it was going to be like during dinner? I thought I said that I didn’t want to eat.<br />
Cancel it now— Suddenly.<br />
I forgot.<br />
Yuhyun, who I thought had left, opened the door again.<br />
It was surprising.<br />
Remove the Awakening Broker from your contacts.<br />
He said, looking at the cell phone on the bed.  </p>
<p>I wouldn’t have let you answer the phone anyway.<br />
……what?I must have made a mistake and sounded like I was going to seek out the broker.<br />
Yuhyun has been staring at me without leaving even though he had finished speaking.<br />
…Did he want me to delete it right now? When I picked up his cell phone and showed him that I had deleted the broker’s contact information, he walked out with a satisfied expression.<br />
My younger brother’s attitude was a little tense, moreso than usual.<br />
‘My status window!’ I quickly opened the status window to take a look.<br />

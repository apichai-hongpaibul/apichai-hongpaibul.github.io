<p>142 Part 2 I could not respond to what Hyunjae Sung was saying.<br />
While Yoohyun had appeared immediately after my return, I still would have run to Haeyeon Guild even if he had not.<br />
I would have needed to confirm that Yoohyun was alive with my own eyes.<br />
Anything else that happened after that would have been similar to what had occurred up to now.  </p>
<p>The reason you cover for your brother and want to do everything for him.<br />
Hyunjae Sung stopped mid-sentence and looked back at me.<br />
I wanted him to shut up, and he did not continue.<br />
I felt sincerely grateful this time.  </p>
<p>You became involved because I came back out of my own will.<br />
Don’t you feel that you’re a victim? You must have worked hard for five years.<br />
I feel sorry for my past self.<br />
Hyunjae Sung clucked his tongue as his expression turned to one of pity.  </p>
<p>To live such a tedious life listening to a foolish lizard’s gibberish.<br />
I don’t know how I managed it.<br />
He is the same person as you.<br />
I wanted to erase the times I wanted to apologize to him even a little.<br />
I thought Hyunjae Sung would think his situation a shame but did not expect him to criticize himself.<br />
Poor Mr.<br />
Hyunjae Sung of before.<br />
I’ll hear this outside the next time in more specific detail.<br />
In your dreams.<br />
Did he really think I would tell him anything? I would not have said anything if he remembered after he got out…and probably would have torn me apart.<br />
Why was that guy so powerful on all accounts? I thought I would definitely win this time, but the memories of past battles before the return had sprung out.<br />
I thought it would be enough to have double of Yoohyun’s stats and an attack skill buff, but Hyunjae Sung had memories of having been strengthened.<br />
It was inevitable since the buff was powerful enough to get me thinking Hyunjae Sung had been involved with the depraved or the filial duty addict.<br />
‘Then, Yerim would be extremely powerful in the psychological world.<br />
’ She had the memory of having received the Mermaid Queen skill.<br />
Only Yoohyun did not have one, and I should remedy this fact.<br />
I turned off the skill grumbling inside, and Hyunjae Sung disappeared while I also felt faint for a moment.<br />
It was right then when someone grabbed my wrist, and I heard a familiar voice.  </p>
<p>Hello, Yoojin Han.<br />
I saw golden eyes narrow at me.<br />
com ***.<br />
No, it’s impossible.<br />
Soyoung Kang stared at the man in front of her with some force.<br />
Minyui Kim from the Hayeon Guild was a B class supporting hunter.<br />
On the other hand, Soyoung Kang was an A class, and while she could not receive the effects of the Dragon Rider skill, she was still an attacker who fulfilled her duties.<br />
So, Minyui Kim should not be able to even move in front of her and shrink like a mouse facing a snake at Soyoung’s glare.<br />
However, Soyoung Kang felt the opposite was happening.<br />
She felt a tiny bit frightened at his cold eyes that stared back at her.<br />
Did he have a special skill? Since Yoojin Han would not go out with only an ordinary B class hunter as his guard, it was a high possibility.<br />
Or perhaps his actual class was different.  </p>
<p>Please wait here.<br />
You received a message that said Mr.<br />
Yoojin Han was fine.<br />
It was only a text message that anyone could send if they took away his phone.<br />
Are you insinuating that our guild leader threatened Mr.<br />
Yoojin Han? You’re stepping out of your bounds.<br />
com Soyoung Kang tightly shut her lips at his cold question.<br />
She did not believe her guild leader would harm Yoojin Han, but he would lay a hand whenever it was necessary.  </p>
<p>He, he is not a person who would lie by a false text message and expose that he had caused some mess.<br />
Soyoung Kang was certain of that.  </p>
<p>Like pretending he was Mr.<br />
Yoojin Han sending a message saying that they would need more time to talk, so come if you’re worried.<br />
Then, I can enter.<br />
No, I meant nothing is wrong up to now.<br />
So, you can’t.<br />
A Sesung hunter approached the two who were causing a skirmish.  </p>
<p>Leave it at that, Hunter Minyui Kim.<br />
I’ll guide you to the sitting room so you can wait comfortably.<br />
Minyui Kim or Yoojin Han did not even glance at the new hunter.<br />
Instead, he took a step forward towards Soyoung Kang, who was blocking his path.<br />
The Sesung hunter moved as he decided that action as a threat.<br />
I cannot overlook any more high-handedness.<br />
So excuse me.<br />
Yoohyun Han grabbed the hunter’s wrist the moment before his hand reached Yoohyun Han’s shoulder.<br />
He twisted it widely while Yoohyun Han’s other hand grabbed the hunter’s neck.  </p>
<p>Unf.<br />
What are you doing?A surprised Soyoung Kang tried to make Yoohyun Han fall by kicking him, as Yoohyun’s grip became stronger.<br />
However, the hunter’s body was dragged upward and blocked Soyoung Kang’s kick faster than she could react.<br />
Soyoung Kang quickly changed the direction of her kick, and her leg swung only to fall on the ground.<br />
She spun once using the foot on the ground as an axis, and this time turned the edge of her hand towards the back of Yoohyun Han’s neck.<br />
However, he was already not there.<br />
The captured hunter rolled on the floor, and Yoohyun Han stood where Soyoung Kang had been and stared at her.<br />
Their positions have been reserved, and the two Sesung Hunters vaguely stared at him brushing his hands off as if nothing happened.  </p>
<p>Give me the portal key, and you can say I took it from you by force.<br />
No, wait.<br />
I’ll come back if he does not open the door after I ring the bell.<br />
That would definitely not happen, and Soyoung Kang bit her bottom lip.<br />
Should she call for more support? But Soyoung Kang had to consider Yoojin Han if she was going to oppress him by force.<br />
They seemed to be close, and she could not displease Yoojin Han.<br />
In all honesty, Soyoung Kang valued her connection to Yoojin Han more than her position within the guild.<br />
Also, the guild leader who could blame her would want her to focus on the latter.  </p>
<p>I’ll try to contact the guild leader for one last time.<br />
She would have to let Minyui Kim go in if he did not answer.<br />
Soyoung Kang quickly took out her phone and called a number.<br />
Hyunjae Sung finally answered back, and he gave his consent after Soyoung Kang’s short explanation.<br />
She let out a long sigh.  </p>
<p>This is the miniature portal key.<br />
Please don’t forget to return it.<br />
Soyoung Kang handed Yoojin Han the key and helped the hunter still lying on the floor with vague eyes.<br />
They stared at Yoojin Han’s back as he walked forward without any hesitation.  </p>
<p>He is not a B class hunter.<br />
No, definitely not.<br />
com for a better experience If he were a B class supporting hunter, they would have to be downgraded to C classes.<br />
‘Hunter Minyui Kim from Haeyeon.<br />
’ Where had he come from, and why was he hiding his class? Soyoung Kang tilted her neck and could not stop looking at the corridor the man had disappeared into.  </p>

<p>Chapter 142 A Shard Within (4) While I was tired of seeing water, the lake reflecting the snowy mountaintops was beautiful.<br />
What I was seeing was a picturesque sight.  </p>
<p>Swiss? Were you really abroad.<br />
I had been traveling.<br />
You were living an easy life.<br />
It was too boring to stay in one place.<br />
I could not take out even one of Hyunjae Sung’s memories, and actually, I could not move anymore.<br />
I felt that it would be too dangerous to overdo myself here.<br />
My mana had already been emptied, but there were other harmful factors.<br />
‘I thought I would be all right since I was fine at that Diarma incident.<br />
’ However, Diarma had been using the skill and not me at the time, and I had only talked when facing Irin.<br />
I should have considered these cases, but I had been too excited at the thought of fighting as an equal to Hyunjae Sung.<br />
However, since I got something out of this, I should use it as much as possible.<br />
Won’t you tell me before you go out.<br />
What.<br />
What you’re hiding.<br />
Like what? I have a lot of things I’m hiding from you.<br />
The truth rather than the boring answer that you can see the future.<br />
I knew that Hyunjae Sung must have noticed after I used double the stats of an S class and the black blood flames.<br />
People could use the powers they had experienced before here, and the ones I used did not exist in the present.<br />
While I had told Hyunjae Sung that he might be able to see the future, but me also having the same ability was strange.<br />
However….<br />
I do not have any reason to tell you.<br />
I won’t remember anything.<br />
com Hyunjae Sung’s voice was soft like he was trying to comfort me.<br />
While I was younger than him by more than a decade, he seemed to think of me as even more younger than that.  </p>
<p>I can’t trust you when you speak like that.<br />
You might be deceiving me.<br />
If I could get out of here with my memories intact, I would not have left you alone.<br />
I would be dissecting you.<br />
That was understandable and made me think I should never cast a mental skill on Hyunjae Sung again.<br />
I thought it would be an easy win, but I was wrong.<br />
If something went wrong, my memories would have been ripped out from me.  </p>
<p>Think of me as your teddy bear.<br />
You shouldn’t keep so much to yourself.<br />
You act like you’re a kind person.<br />
I might cry at your warm words.<br />
I’m always nice.<br />
Have you already forgotten what happened last night? Should I give you knitting things to prevent dementia.<br />
I appreciate you are trying to celebrate my birthday, but I want something already completed.<br />
com for a better experience I should knit him a hot pink muffler about five meters long.<br />
Hyunjae Sung waited without urging me on.<br />
I was attracted to the idea that the person I would talk to would not remember anything.<br />
He would respond well if I spoke about what I was hiding, and it might lead to a fruitful discussion about the future.<br />
‘The depraved told me I should not talk about the return, but it wouldn’t matter if he could not remember anything.<br />
’ I looked up at Hyunjae Sung as I sat on a boulder.  </p>
<p>It’s not much.<br />
He would not remember and would probably force me to speak if I remained silent to the end.<br />
It would be better to speak up first.  </p>
<p>I returned from five years into the future by using an item.<br />
All right.<br />
Hyunjae Sung spoke like he had heard something trivial that happened once every month.<br />
The lump in my throat loosened at his tone, and I spoke as if nothing was wrong.  </p>
<p>Don’t you have any questions like whether the Sesung Guild Leader is alive or dead? I’ll tell you a couple of things out of goodwill.<br />
com A cloud of light that moved delicately according to its owner’s will appeared from his fingertips at my words.  </p>
<p>It’s about five years’ worth.<br />
Was he talking about his skill experience? That he would be living after five years?.<br />
You seemed to be alive but missing.<br />
That’s odd.<br />
You were suspected of murdering Department Head Taewon Song before you disappeared.<br />
Hyunjae Sung tilted his head as I asked, my eyes wondering if the suspicion was correct.  </p>
<p>I cannot think of a reason I would do such a thing right now.<br />
It’s boring without an audience.<br />
Moreover, the association is too small to compensate.<br />
Too small? However, an S class hunter would be missed since they were not rocks rolling on the ground.<br />
Hyunjae Sung seemed to value human resources on his terms as he kept MKC and Sudam Guild Leaders alive.<br />
Well, I might have to remove the word human since he did not treat them as such.  </p>
<p>However, you two would not have been strangers since you have that loot skill.<br />
Taewon Song would not have handed in his primary skill when he was alive and well.<br />
I did not know how he gave it to Hyunjae Sung, while I could make a vague guess.  </p>
<p>How about asking the person in question why he would give me his skill before dying.<br />
I feel like he would strangle me again.<br />
Taewon Song would look at me if I were crazy.<br />
I might ask him because I was curious about how he would actually react.  </p>
<p>And…let’s go out if you don’t have any questions.<br />
You wouldn’t remember it anyway.<br />
Ah, I had lived like I am now, so I have nothing to say.<br />
Hyunjae Sung would think of my life story as trivial.<br />
He opened his mouth as I stood up from the boulder.  </p>
<p>I congratulate you on repairing your relationship with your younger brother.<br />
I felt faint for a minute, so I did not know what I had felt at his words.<br />
The ensuing silence might have been either long or short.  </p>
<p>…Your memories.<br />
I don’t remember anything.<br />
Then, are you really trying to become a fortune-teller.<br />
When someone comes back to the past, he or she would act on their deepest desires.<br />
That desire would be something that the individual had regretted the most in the future.<br />
Based on my current state, you returned about two months ago, and that was when you became closer to your younger brother.  </p>

<p>141 Part 2 Did some of his memories before the return spring outside when Hyunjae Sung tried to search them? I did not know and had to ask the children later.  </p>
<p>Can you get out of this place.<br />
I think I can now if you can lift the skill.<br />
So, Hyunjae Sung had been stuck here, but acting like nothing was wrong.  </p>
<p>Did you remember anything.<br />
Being thirty-years-old suits you best.<br />
He remembered something unnecessary, but the number thirty implied that Hyunjae Sung had information before the return despite being unable to remember them on his own.  </p>
<p>I don’t know why memories like these are mixed up.<br />
I can predict moves in a fight, not the future.<br />
Maybe your skill is about to be upgraded.<br />
Predicting the future would be nice.<br />
com for a better experience.<br />
I don’t like prophecies, and I really don’t want to be a fortune teller.<br />
Hyunjae Sung was indifferent and it was too early to talk about the regression.<br />
I had not even told Yoohyun, and I should act like I could see the future.<br />
Moreover, this would be a chance to check something out.  </p>
<p>I want to help you remember.<br />
Something will pop up like that time I cut open Diarma.<br />
I changed my right hand to beast mode, and Hyunjae Sung found my hand with golden scales and sharp dragon claws.  </p>
<p>I did not know you had that kind of skill.<br />
We are in a psychological world now.<br />
I don’t have omnipotence, but I can use the abilities I experienced through my teacher’s skill.<br />
I could use Yoohyun’s doubled stats from before the return, so the attack effects would be doubled.<br />
While I could not receive doubled effects of the cursed venom dragon, it would still be enough to take on Hyunjae Sung.  </p>
<p>You should also start drinking some water!A significant drop of water gathered in the air.<br />
Hyunjae Sung looked a bit surprised at the water cascade falling over him but soon smiled.<br />
com I was winning at the beginning.<br />
While Hyunjae Sung was number one in the rankings, he still had a blank of five years.<br />
Also, I could use his battle prediction skills.<br />
While the skill was nullified when the opponent had the same skill, making him unable to use it was enough.<br />
When I managed to rip Hyunjae Sung’s shoulder open, that was when things went sour.<br />
He began to remember memories of fighting from before the return.<br />
He even adjusted to the psychological world and changed the setting whenever he wanted.<br />
I tried to react but could not match Hyunjae Sung perhaps because the mentality of my actual body and magic stats affected the situation.<br />
My surroundings changed again as electric attacks blocked my vision.<br />
It was a valley with a sharp cliff.<br />
I felt my body fall and quickly spread my wings to land between the rocks.<br />
I soared upward, crushing the boulders below.<br />
The golden chains flew towards me in the air, and I blocked them by creating ice walls as they fiercely attacked me.<br />
The chains delved into the ice, and the walls melted into the water with a blinding light.<br />
There was an immense hydrogen explosion.<br />
That crazy guy was using electrolysis, and the barriers I managed to make just in time shattered.  </p>
<p>I said not to do this!Hyunjae Sung laughed, and a bracelet with blue jewels shook in one of his wrists.<br />
That was a grace he stole from me when I thought I was ahead in the beginning.<br />
Now, I could not use damage negation items since he was wearing it nonchalantly.  </p>
<p>Isn’t it better than when I exploded in the river.<br />
com If Yerim had not managed to succeed in transporting us, it would have been all over as an entire river became a bomb.<br />
Yerim probably could not use ice and water skills.<br />
The explosive power was astounding with the added magic.<br />
I could use Hyunjae Sung’s electric skills, but not to that extent.<br />
There was a limit to experiencing them using my teacher’s skills.<br />
While most of my electric attacks were thunderbolts showering down, that guy pulled off a trick of stealing them and doubling the power before sending them back to me, so I also could not use that.<br />
While he had five years of memories and electricity was his main attribute, he was above and beyond.<br />
‘Should I use blood flames?’ I spread black fire on the ground and rushed at Hyunjae Sung.<br />
I had to get that grace back to win.  </p>
<p>You need to learn physical skills.<br />
A gloved hand lightly passed a dragon’s claws that rushed at him.<br />
I used a tail to strike the ground and twist my body as he tried to bend my arm and throw me away.<br />
I scattered poison at the same time.  </p>
<p>Give me an antidote.<br />
Hyunjae Sung took a large step and smoothly moved his body behind my back.<br />
I could not turn off the poison resistance skill, and his range was way too wide.<br />
Get out!I swung a thorny tail, which he stepped on to jump away.  </p>
<p>You were the one to approach me first.<br />
The ends of his coat grazed my cheek as if to tease me.<br />
I should cut my arm with a dagger and use the blood flames.<br />
Hyunjae Sung took out a potion and threw it to my wound.<br />
That potion had to be a high class since the bleeding stopped and the wound healed just by a few drops.  </p>
<p>Yoohyun’s blood flames are bothersome.<br />
Did he block me with this method? While he could not use this means as potions were not allowed in ranking battles, I had not expected it.  </p>
<p>Did you remember the black blood flames.<br />
Vaguely, but this memory would dissipate when we get out.  </p>

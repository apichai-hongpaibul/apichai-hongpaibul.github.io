<p>I fell asleep with Yoohyun’s faint voice in my ears.<br />
You bastard.<br />
<em> * </em> -Peep, peep.<br />
The little bird sitting on Yoojin Han’s chest sang softly.<br />
Yoohyun looked down on his brother deep asleep.<br />
One of the pills was a painkiller and fever reducer, but the other was a sleep inducer.<br />
It dropped from S class dungeons, and expert hunters would use them for sleep when their senses had become too sensitive after completing a dungeon.<br />
The pill was known to relax the body and have psychological effects for deep sleep, but Yoohyun had not used it after he had bought the medicine.<br />
While he was allured to an intensive rest, he did not like his body to be out of his control.  </p>
<p>You shouldn’t take them so easily.<br />
Yoohyun gently admonished his brother, but he would have been more bothered if Yoojin had suspected and resisted him.<br />
Yoohyun pressed the call button, and the call was answered shortly.  </p>
<p>He’s asleep.<br />
[You must have put him to sleep.<br />
Yoohyun did not comment on Hyunjae Sung’s piercing words.  </p>
<p>What happened to Taewon Song?[I wonder how you were at that place.<br />
A question answered his question, and Yoohyun responded indifferently.  </p>
<p>I’m asking because I was not there.<br />
[Can you send an S class scallion from your kitchen? I want to see one.<br />
com [If you really weren’t there, there must have been an S class scallion.<br />
Yoohyun’s brow furrowed in Hyunjae Sung’s strange words.  </p>
<p>Tell me about Taewon Song since I need to decide what to do in the future.<br />
[You don’t have to worry about chief Song.<br />
Hyunjae Sung continued leisurely.<br />
[He could not protect Yoojin against me.<br />
That would firmly fix Yoojin Han’s place for Taewon Song.<br />
He would have been disturbed to see a sheep playing with a wolf and wonder if the sheep was a wolf in sheepskin.<br />
However, a sheep is a sheep if he was taken by a wolf despite a sheepdog’s protection.<br />
[Of course, since a wolf is a wolf even if he’s pretending to be a sheepdog, a sheep could get hurt during protection.<br />
Maybe I should send leader Song a comforting message.<br />
Yoohyun opened his mouth as he let Hyunjae Sung’s slow laugh pass.<br />
What did my brother ask you to not say to me?[So, he did keep it a secret from you.<br />
Yoohyun breathed softly to control his anger as he heard Hyunjae Sung’s pitying voice.<br />
He knew something that Yoohyun did not.<br />
That bothered him to no end, and the back of his neck stiffened.<br />
However, even if it was possible, Yoohyun could not remove Hyunjae Sung.<br />
That bastard held some meaning to Yoojin, and if he disappeared, his brother would push himself even further than he had been up to now.<br />
Since Hyunjae Sung was efficient and useful, Yoohyun had to tolerate him if he was cooperatived with Yoojin.  </p>
<p>Please tell me.<br />
There was a coherent reply this time to Yoohyun’s subdued voice.<br />
[His chest wound.  </p>
<p>com for the best novel reading experience [It was a scar that a B class healing skill was useless on.<br />
If it were a flesh wound, healing skills lower than a B class would remove it cleanly.<br />
So, it was not an ordinary wound.<br />
Yoohyun unconsciously clenched his teeth as he reached out to Yoojin.<br />
-Peep! The little bird pecked at his hand as if to let his nurturer sleep.<br />
The chick rolled and moved right next to Yoojin’s face and peeped as if to complain.<br />
-Peep! Peep!.<br />
Be quiet.<br />
Yoojin would not wake easily, but if that chick incessantly peeped, who knows what would happen.<br />
Yoohyun tapped the little beak and unbuttoned his brother’s pajama top.<br />
There was a wound, as Hyunjae Sung had said.<br />
It was a cut near the heart, a recent one he had not seen.<br />
Yoojin frowned and picked up a high-class potion to try, but even that could not remove the little scar.<br />
What is this?[Yoojin Han seems to be behind something fun again, but he’s keeping it a secret for now.<br />
I only know that it has to do something with a magic stone.<br />
If you concentrate, you can feel a faint aura of the magic stone from the wound.<br />
Yoohyun placed his fingertips on the wound and concentrated as Hyunjae Sung had said.<br />
There was faint, strange magic.<br />
He remembered that the monsters would only rush at Yoojin.<br />
Monsters are more aware of magic stones compared to humans.<br />
The magic stone detector was made using a monster’s skill.<br />
So, to monsters Yoojin Han was ‘a prey with an F class body but with a high-class magic stone…If Yoohyun could feel a faint aura, the magic stone was not a low to middle class magic stone.<br />
Even an S class hunter who is sensitive to magic had difficulties knowing the magic stone in a monster.<br />
Even an S class stone could not be felt if it was deeply embedded.<br />
So, if the aura was anything to go by, the magic stone was at least an S class or stronger….<br />
What are you trying to do, Hyung?Yoohyun ended the call uneasily, and the phone fell on the bed with a thud.<br />
com * * * My view was filled with white snowflakes falling when I opened my eyes.<br />
It was then that I knew this was a dream, as snow fell incessantly, and white branches reached out endlessly.<br />
A tree from which snow fell.<br />
‘I knew I would see this sooner or later.<br />
’ Maybe because of my fear resistance skill, I had seldom dreamed of my little brother before my return.<br />
However, my fear resistance level was lowered and dreams attacked you viciously as soon as you lower your guard.<br />
I will probably get no sleep for a while.<br />
They had said that the skill would last for about four days, and since it was going to be twice as effective, it might last longer.<br />
I had so much to do and now everything was going haywire.<br />
Taewon Song, it is too much.<br />
Can you cancel the skill? ‘At least this place isn’t too bad.<br />
’ Since it was a dream, the place would be different from reality, but I looked around to confirm in advance.<br />
While I could not move my body, I could shift the view.<br />
The snowfields were wide and barrenly empty.<br />
I seemed to be standing in the middle of a snowy field in the middle of nowhere.<br />
com I saw something then.<br />
A body that seemed too small was between the thick roots of the tree.<br />
I take my words back.<br />
It was a nightmare.<br />
But I could not take my eyes off it, as I would in a common nightmare.  </p>

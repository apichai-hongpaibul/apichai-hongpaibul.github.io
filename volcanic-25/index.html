<h1 id="vocanic-age-chapter-25">Vocanic Age Chapter 25</h1>
<p>Editor: Imagine
Ju Seo Cheon yelled heroically and charged forward.
 His target was Mak Won Gap.</p>
<p>Wh, what are you doing! Mak Won Gap got scared and stepped back.
 The courage he had shown when he first entered couldnt be seen anymore.</p>
<p>Get rid of that bastard first!
The nickname of brat had changed into bastard.</p>
<p>Hy, hyung-nim.
 He says that he is a Sword Examiner of Mount Hua.
 The one that got to stand at the forefront after the death of the big guy spoke in a scared voice.
 His body was trembling slightly.</p>
<p>Mount Hua.
 That name was terror itself for low leveled martial artists of the River of Death.</p>
<p>Al, also, obviously hes not even twenty yet… Hes a member of the Lotus Peak without a doubt!
Everyone here knew what it meant when someone that wasnt even twenty came out to Kang Ho.</p>
<p>If we touch the Lotus Peak…: Someone spoke carefully.
 A member of the Lotus Peak was someone that received special treatment even inside of Mount Hua.</p>
<p>It was hard to touch him as they were scared of the aftermath.</p>
<p>You idiots! Mak Won Gap raised his voice with a red face.
 Blue veins had appeared in his neck.</p>
<p>So are you planning on retreating here? Anyone knows that this place only has injured people, if we escape we will obviously be a laughing stock and our lives will end right here!
They had separated a hundred warriors for the decoy.
 It meant that the damages the main troop would suffer would obviously increase.</p>
<p>They had to pass through here somehow, take over this place and take the families of the people at Weng An as disciples.</p>
<p>And you, disciple of Mount Hua.
 No, member of the Lotus Peak, you are still a child in the end!
Mak Won Gap kicked the back of a warrior that was trying to pull out.</p>
<p>In the first place, not having followed the Fourteenth Gallant Sword means that his skills are lacking! Dont be scared and suppress him quickly, you useless bastards! Maybe they got persuaded by Mak Won Gaps yell or they became scared that the warriors of the River of Death raised their swords again.
 Most of them were looking at Ju Seo Cheon.</p>
<p>Why is it that you speak more than the Righteous Faction? Ju Seo Cheon contained his laughter and put more strength in his hand holding the sword.</p>
<p>Stop babbling and speak with your sword!
After Ju Seo Cheon stopped speaking the warriors of both sides clashed once again.</p>
<p>Remember the words of young master Ju! The second rate martial artist that had been assisting the places that got pierced through or were having a hard time, yelled.</p>
<p>Thirty minutes ago, Ju Seo Cheon had taken the third and second rate martial artists and set up a brief strategy.</p>
<p>At first, the warriors didnt even try to listen to him because they thought that Ju Seo Cheon was useless.
 But Ju Seo Cheon said,
I will spread that you tried to escape alone while trying to take and escape with the properties but you failed and died.
 If you are warriors that have families to protect, you will know what will happen to that family of yours, right? A demon, a demon is here!
….
And threatened them like that.</p>
<p>Most of them had already given up on despair so they decided to follow Ju Seo Cheon without complaining much.</p>
<p>Actually, it wasnt something that could be called a strategy.
 It was simply blackmail.</p>
<p>They had to surround the gate so that not every enemy could enter.</p>
<p>In addition, the second rate martial artists would assist the places that got opened.</p>
<p>Lastly, Ju Seo Cheon would defeat the warriors that belonged to the River of Death one by one in the center of the battlefield.</p>
<p>When they first heard that tactic the warriors thought that Ju Seo Cheon was crazy, that he was being too overconfident.</p>
<p>It was obvious to think like that.
 He was only a twelve year old kid, even though he belonged to the Lotus Peak.
 On top of that, it was his first time in Murim.</p>
<p>They didnt know how he would act after his first murder but he wanted them to leave everything to him.
 All their rationality had escaped far away.</p>
<p>The enemy warriors got closer before they could even object and in the end all of them despaired and proceeded with the tactic.
 But what was this?
The tactic was a success.</p>
<p>No, the tactic wasnt the problem.
 The power Ju Seo Cheon showed was just too shocking.</p>
<p>At first, everyone just blinked and doubted their eyes.</p>
<p>But they finally got able to believe it after Ju Seo Cheon defeated three more warriors after the first one.</p>
<p>They didnt know how this happened.
 It was a martial power that exceeded common sense.</p>
<p>They werent able to hide their happiness when they got hope of being able to get out of this place alive.</p>
<p>Left wing, you are delving in too deeply so be careful! I understand how you feel but we have fewer numbers so calm down a bit!
Ju Seo Cheon checked the situation even while swinging his sword.
 He had a bit of commanding experience due to his past life, although not much.</p>
<p>Yes! The third rate warriors answered in a dignified way.
 The despair that was filling them up until then had disappeared.</p>
<p>They were fewer in numbers and their morale had fallen to the bottom.</p>
<p>There was no hope.
.</p>
<p>There were injured people behind them.
 The people that couldnt fight were trembling in fright while hiding.</p>
<p>They were embarrassed for having thought for a moment of leaving them behind so they reflected on that and moved.</p>
<p>‘There it is.</p>
<p>The third rate warriors saw it.</p>
<p>‘The back of the third rate warriors is there.</p>
<p>A back that was more reliable than any others.</p>
<p>The back of a kid that wasnt even 20 yet.</p>
<p>It may be a bit embarrassing but they relied on the back of that kid and fought fiercely by following his orders.</p>
<p>Die!
A warrior belonging to the River of Death yelled and charged forward.</p>
<p>Ju Seo Cheon pulled out the sword that was stuck in the chest of an enemy warrior by his side and then swung his sword by twisting his body.</p>
<p>Swuuuung!
A sharp sound exploded and the sword soaked in blood drew a straight line.</p>
<p>Huup! The Apostle of Death warrior bent back his head as if he expected it.
 The tip of the sword grazed by his neck with a thin margin.</p>
<p>Hahaha! Its the end!
The warrior yelled out in joy.</p>
<p>No matter how outstanding one was, it would take time to retrieve your sword so he tried to swing his sword hard even before his head turned to its original place.</p>
<p>Ho, you are quite good.
 Ju Seo Cheon complimented him and put strength in his legs.
 The well trained muscles in his legs swelled up.</p>
<p>And then, circulated internal energy to the end of his legs and kicked the shin of the warrior with all his strength.</p>
<p>Graaaagh! A sound of something breaking was heard.
 The warrior got his leg broken even before he swung his sword.</p>
<p>The, the one that calls himself a Sword Examiner of Mount Hua…!
Disciples that belonged to the Righteous Faction, and especially the ones that had strong pride on their sword like Mount Hua, tried not to use arts besides swordsmanship.</p>
<p>Even if they had the Plum Blossom Fist Techniques, there were some that commited suicide at the shame they felt of losing their sword while fighting.</p>
<p>On top of that, the opponent of the warrior was the peak of Mount Hua, that was said to be the pride of Mount Hua.</p>
<p>He couldnt understand him launching a kick.</p>
<p>Even I dont use it much except for really dangerous situations.
 And after facing war, even the prideful martial artists of the Righteous Faction would lose their pride by quite a bit .
 Ju Seo Cheon was also one of those types.</p>
<p>But his way of thinking changed after having almost experienced death and in really desperate situations.</p>
<p>That wasnt only for Ju Seo Cheon.
 Martial artists of the Righteous faction that had a solid way of thinking also faced several changes after going through the age of war.</p>
<p>Save… What? I cant hear you because you belong to the River of Death.
 Slash!
The head of the warrior got separated from his body.</p>
<p>Hiiik!
The warriors of the River of Death that were about to breakthrough got terrified and the faces of the warriors behind them also turned pale.</p>
<p>They were third rate in the first place.
 They couldnt demonstrate their skills in front of an overwhelming power.</p>
<p>In the case of martial artists belonging to the Death Faction, such things like pride and honor didnt really matter.
 Fear spread in an instant.</p>
<p>Th, thirty people were killed by that kid! Someone got terrified and screamed.</p>
<p>The hundred warriors got reduced to seventy.</p>
<p>Think differently! He will be undoubtedly exhausted because he fought against thirty people with his life on the line! Mak Won Gap yelled desperately.</p>
<p>‘I cant fall back here.
 I dont know about others but if I, the person in charge, escapes I will certainly be chased down.</p>
<p>Mak Won Gap gulped down.
 It was easy for the person in charge to accumulate merits but the punishment they suffered wasnt light either.
 It was even more so for the River of Death, that didnt care about circumstances.</p>
<p>Push! Push! Push him back! Mak Won Gap kicked the back of his subordinates.
 He raised his sword and shouted in a loud voice.
 I will report to my superiors so that you receive a gold plate to the one that gets me his head!
Mak Won Gap didnt have that much authority.
 He had just babbled on because he was being pressed by fear.</p>
<p>Uwaaaa!
The warriors of the River of Death reacted to the word gold plate.</p>
<p>In the case of the Death Faction and especially the ones that lived a low class lives tended to lose their minds at material things like money, rather than honor or pride.</p>
<p>Th, this! The second rate martial artist of Weng An turned pale.
 They were holding on well but it became hard to endure as the warriors of the River of Death charged together in an agitated state.</p>
<p>Until now they were showing a passive attitude because they saw Ju Seo Cheons overwhelming power but it became the opposite now.</p>
<p>Yo, young master Ju! The second rate martial artists called out Ju Seo Cheon in a pledging voice.
 The third rate martial artists also hesitated and started to get pushed back.</p>
<p>‘Damn!
Ju Seo Cheon tried to turn back.</p>
<p>Dieeee! But the warriors of the River of Death gathered over to stop Ju Seo Cheon.
 They werent that threatening but it was difficult to go and reinforce others.</p>
<p>Someones voice rang the battlefield when the encirclement was about to get broken through.</p>
<p>Hey you bastards! Boom!
An unknown explosion was heard.</p>
<p>Fwoooosh!
Something fell above the heads of the warriors of the River of Death before they could even grasp the identity of the sound.</p>
<p>Guaaaak!
Aghh, where did this come from! Screams were heard everywhere.</p>
<p>The warriors that were charging like boars got scared.</p>
<p>The things that fell above their heads were arrows.
 And there were at least twenty raining down on them all at once.
 ….
Hahaha!
Ju Seo Cheon also became a target for the arrows as he was in the middle of enemy grounds but he just fended them off with his sword.</p>
<p>His eyes were looking at Zhuge Seung Kye, who was holding up a bamboo barrel that was tied with ropes.</p>
<p>These Zhuge Sega bastards are so dirty.</p>
<p>The Bamboo Crossbow.</p>
<p>It was a weapon that fired several arrows after placing arrows inside the bamboo barrel and pulling a string.</p>
<p>So, that means…
Seung Kye developed an assassination weapon and they were embarrassed of that as members of the Righteous Sect so they went and sold it off to the Sichuan Family?
Haha! I succeeded! Zhuge Seung Kye raised his bamboo crossbow and raised his arms in joy.</p>
<p>It was pure happiness of having succeeded in a challenge.</p>
<p>‘He is with no doubt the Late Known Partner of Heaven! </p></div>

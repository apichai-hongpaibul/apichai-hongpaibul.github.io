<p>.  </p>
<p>Hmm, wouldn’t it be okay definitely Awakening C-Rank, no B-Rank and higher, and finishing the rest with counseling? I was thinking of hiring people to assist… no, if there are that many in the first place, shouldn’t the Association know to assist me on their own? And I just send the data saying ‘there are these optimized initial skills’.<br />
At any rate, I only know the skill names.<br />
Why did I have to do everything? I won’t.<br />
If I said I would take just the B-Rank and higher, the Association probably would be displeased, but let’s just say it’s my reward.  </p>
<p>Tell other people to do it, other people.<br />
That’s pretty resolute of you, ahjussi.<br />
Resolute or whatever, is there anybody who would want to purposely suffer?Yerim exaggeratedly widened her eyes.  </p>
<p>There is, right in front of my eyes.<br />
That’s why Guild Leader is so cold[1 lately.<br />
……Yoohyun? He’s still mad.<br />
He’s completely in a bad mood.<br />
Truthfully, Guild Leader – I get that he worries about ahjussi, but to others, it seems pretty excessive.<br />
Even if one or two more skills were added on, there isn’t much that would exactly change.<br />
If a gold nugget that everybody already wanted got two times bigger, it’s still the same that everyone wants it.<br />
com It was completely correct.<br />
Whether it was added on that I could find out the expected Awakening rank and skills or not, the guys that would try to pull nonsense on me would still be the same.  </p>
<p>It’s true that guy is excessive, but still, I have to pacify him.<br />
And I said I would go into a dungeon with him.<br />
Oh, don’t be like that and tell him while you’re at it.<br />
To be reasonable about interfering.<br />
And come over to me!…‘Come over to her’, what was she talking about.<br />
She was affiliated to Haeyeon at any rate.  </p>
<p>For dungeons, you can go with me! I can finish a low rank dungeon by myself now.<br />
Yerim said confidently.<br />
Then again, she would soon be 30 levels.<br />
If it really didn’t work out, should I go in with Yerim?.<br />
Do you have the time.<br />
I’m an S-Rank Hunter.<br />
I make my own schedule! Please just say when.<br />
Hey punk, you have to think about the other Hunters you work with.<br />
‘S-Rank Hunter’ or whatever, you can’t act like that already.<br />
I can just tell them ahead of time.<br />
When are you going in.<br />
Um… wait.<br />
Let me check with Yoohyun first.<br />
I sent a text saying that if he was busy lately, I could go to the dungeon we were going to go to, with Yerim.<br />
When I did, a reply came back immediately.<br />
When he didn’t even pick up the phone these past few days.<br />
[There’s no need.<br />
I set aside some time.  </p>
<p>He said he would go himself.<br />
Ah- I knew he would do that!Yerim had a dull expression.  </p>
<p>Go with me.<br />
Okay, next time.<br />
While we’re at it, a place with good scenery, with packed lunches!Was she going on a field trip? Though a low rank dungeon would probably be at the level of a field trip.<br />
As I became pickled in the mana potions, after completely searching everyone through to the afternoon, I found two B-Rank special skill holders.<br />
The actual special skill Awakening attempts were going to start after the building construction finished, so the Hunters that were on standby outside just took their contact information and names.<br />
I had to gather at least fifteen people within two weeks, so it would be good if similar amounts as today appeared.<br />
‘They said tomorrow was Garosu-gil[2, right?’ It was hard borrowing a 1-story in a good location.<br />
Though it all worked out with money to a certain extent.  </p>
<p>Peace, Chirpie, were you well?I wanted to take both of them with me, but the law didn’t allow it yet.<br />
It wasn’t like I was going around by myself, and there were A-Ranks and higher following me, so why couldn’t I? I should nudge the Association’s side to tell them to do some work.  </p>
<p>com for the best novel reading experience When I was taking care of the kids’ food, Myeongwoo popped out of the air.<br />
It was like that yesterday too, but his face was really bad.<br />
Like that, he would die.  </p>
<p>It’s not something urgent, so why don’t you take it easy?At my words, Myeongwoo smiled, even with a complexion that said he was exhausted to death.  </p>
<p>I’m going to make at least up to A-Rank before the construction finishes.<br />
And my goal is S-Rank.<br />
Isn’t that being too excessive.<br />
It’s worth the suffering, so it’s okay.<br />
It’s much more worth living this way than when my future was dark.<br />
At that time, that wasn’t living.<br />
And now, I’m really living.<br />
He was really living.<br />
Hearing that, I couldn’t dissuade him further.<br />
I should make him eat the restorative medicine that Kim Sunghan sends.<br />
After I used the Seed-Leaf skill over and over, I found three more B-Rank special skill holders.<br />
There was also one B-Rank combat Hunter.<br />
If only it hadn’t rained in the middle, I could have discovered more.<br />
I hadn’t considered the variable of weather.<br />
com ‘Bustling streets aren’t bad either, but going through whole companies or schools really could lessen the overlap in checking.<br />
’ Once I handed over the results of special skill Awakened People, I should discuss with the Hunter Association and government and tour the country…… I should limit it to one or two times a week.<br />
I won’t increase the work any more.<br />
I won’t do any more than that.  </p>
<p>Peace, we’re going to go into a dungeon today.<br />
-Geureureung I said, rubbing Peace’s neck.  </p>
<p>It’s where you used to live, do you remember? …Though it wouldn’t be a particularly good memory.<br />
From Peace’s point of view, humans killed his family and kidnapped him.<br />
…Was it possible for him to become friendly with that guy Yoohyun?.<br />
Even so, it’s not like we can not do dungeon attacks.<br />
Though later, there were organizations that formed that said we had to guarantee a monster’s right to live.<br />
They had argued that dungeons bursting open was a natural phenomenon, so we had to make a protective reserve for monsters outside of dungeons.<br />
Though that didn’t make any sense.<br />
Would monsters quietly stay only inside a reserve? First of all, communication had to be possible for coexistence or whatever to be attempted.<br />
Since they were monsters that started off with attacking when they saw people.<br />
Still, my brother isn’t a bad guy.<br />
……Though he’s probably the biggest villain in the world to you.<br />
I’ll tell him to treat you well.<br />
I held Peace in my arms and patted him.<br />
It would be good if he didn’t have memories of inside the dungeon at all.<br />
Though seeing how he wasn’t acting fierce toward Yoohyun, it seemed like he couldn’t remember.<br />
-Chirp! When I held only Peace, Chirpie circled my feet as if asking me to lift it up too.  </p>
<p>I can’t take you.<br />
It’s a D-Rank dungeon so it’s dangerous.<br />
-Chirp?.<br />
No.<br />
When I said it again, it became sullen as if it had understood.<br />
Lately, its expressions had become very diverse.<br />
And the things it was interested in besides eating also grew.  </p>
<p>Wait here quietly.<br />
com for the best novel reading experience -Cheep cheep I put Chirpie in the basket and went outside with Peace.<br />
[I’ll be down in the parking lot.<br />
After sending a text to Yoohyun, I walked.<br />
The Hunter next to the elevator greeted me with a smile.  </p>
<p>Will you be going down now.<br />
Yes.<br />
I am going to go to the parking lot.<br />
Without even me waving my hand, they got the elevator for me and even pressed the button.<br />
I shouldn’t get used to things like this, but everyone was excessively nice.<br />
When I arrived at the parking lot, I saw Yoohyun, who had arrived first.<br />
His expression was really hard.<br />
And it seemed a little sullen too.  </p>
<p>Please have a safe trip.<br />
com The Hunter who came with me noticed the mood and went back.  </p>
<p>Loosen your expression a little.<br />
Are you planning on going around advertising that you’re mad at me or something.<br />
It’s not that I’m mad.<br />
Then.<br />
……Do I even have the right to be mad?Then he quickly turned around.<br />
What was he talking about? It felt like he was going through a belated puberty or something.  </p>
<p>If there’s something upsetting you, tell me properly.<br />
You’re not going to talk to me properly anyways.<br />
Oh, that, I didn’t have anything to say.<br />
But even if I said something, it didn’t seem like he would believe me.<br />
com for a better experience.<br />
But it’s not like you’re telling me everything either.<br />
There’s no difference with unilaterally ‘protecting’ and keeping your mouth shut, you know.<br />
That’s why I said I’m not mad.<br />
I’m just upset on my own, so don’t worry about it.<br />
That sure wasn’t worrying at all.<br />
Yoohyun opened the car’s back seat door for me.<br />
There weren’t other people besides that guy.<br />
With this atmosphere, it was better for there not to be.  </p>
<p>How long are you going to be upset for.<br />
I’m thinking about it.<br />
What I should do with hyung.<br />
Truthfully, I don’t have the ability to handle it.<br />
I recognize that.<br />
I also know that I’m being imprudent, keeping on interfering with hyung.<br />
Yoohyun said, sitting in the driver’s seat.<br />
I felt weird, since he was saying that kind of thing.<br />
I really wasn’t much compared to my brother.  </p>
<p>…Why would you say it like that.<br />
We’re brothers, so whatever the surrounding situation, we can worry about each other.<br />
It’s the truth.<br />
I have to acknowledge that you’ve left my hold, but I’m like this because I don’t want to, so there’s nothing for you to worry about.<br />
Cutting it off with that, he started the car.<br />
com Hm, I didn’t know what I should say.<br />
And I couldn’t say ‘it’s okay to keep on interfering’.<br />
But I didn’t want to settle it by saying ‘there’s no helping it’ either.<br />
Above all, the part where he said he didn’t have the ability.<br />
……How was it imprudent for a younger brother to worry about his older brother? The same for the opposite.<br />
Though yeah, in my case, it was like a cat worrying over a tiger.<br />
Still, it wasn’t like I couldn’t.<br />
The dungeon wasn’t that far so we arrived quickly.<br />
It was a mixed seashore and forest environment under Haeyeon’s management.<br />
The normal monsters appeared in the forest, and the boss monster in the seashore.<br />
-Keuheung! As soon as the monsters were visible, Peace jumped down from my arms.<br />
The Olgors, the monsters that seemed like they were monkeys mixed with cats, fiercely bared their teeth at Peace.  </p>
<p>He was like that with the Tooth Moles, but are there any cases where monsters get along well.<br />
If the species are different, usually they try to kill and eat the opponent.<br />
That’s why in high rank dungeons where several different species of similar rank come out, you can handle them by purposely causing a fight between monster groups.<br />
So it’s like that.<br />
You know pretty well.<br />
I nodded my head and checked my brother’s mood.<br />
While we were at it, we should properly talk things out.<br />
com [The preparation to talk is done! That’s right, talk.<br />
Huh? No, wait-.<br />
Right after the message window popped up, the surroundings became dark.<br />
Then, one, two, firefly-like small lights floated up.  </p>
<p>…Yoohyun?I couldn’t see either Yoohyun or Peace.<br />
Was it a separate space altogether? ‘I can’t see anything.<br />
’ The lights were floating around, but it was just that.<br />
There was nothing they shone on, and it was just dark.  </p>
<p>Hey excuse me?If you pulled me over, then say something at least.<br />
com As if replying, the group of lights gathered in front of me.<br />
A rectangular window was made, and a Korean keyboard appeared.<br />
It seemed like a giant smartphone screen.<br />
Deer: Hi, darling[3! Tree: Nice to meet you! How were you in the meantime? Newcomer: Hello!! Wolf: Hi, sweetie![4 Water Droplet: Can you see it well? You can see it well, right? I don’t know if it came up properly.<br />
On the screen, words appeared in a row.<br />
Was this a chat[5? Was it a chat window? ‘First of all, so there’s five, huh.<br />
’ After hesitating a bit, I raised my hand over the keyboard.<br />
com Honey[6: Hello.<br />
…What was this nickname.<br />
Change it.<br />
Weren’t there any chat settings? Deer: Ohhh, our cutie! So you’ve connected safely! Send me a welcome kiss~.<br />
Wolf: There’s a lot you’re curious about, right? Ask anything! Water Droplet: Not anything! Sorry, Honey.<br />
Please ignore those two.<br />
Uselessly barging in.<br />
Newcomer is going to block them soon.<br />
First of all, I will tell you the precautions.<br />
It was a relief that at least one of them was normal.<br />
Water Droplet: There is a limit on the information we can tell you.<br />
The connecting passage between that side and this side is narrow.<br />
Originally it was actually closed.<br />
Right now, the passage was forcefully opened, so it will cut off if the amount of information goes above a certain amount.<br />
Honey: Does the chitchat also count as information? Can’t I just use my name for the nickname? Water Droplet: Chitchat is fine.<br />
Names are also information, so you cannot.<br />
Above all, we need to hide Honey still.<br />
com for the best novel reading experience Honey: From what? Deer: A guy we can’t directly call by name!^▽^ Were they Vol**mort? Water Droplet: Looks like they weren’t blocked yet.<br />
Still, it is not wrong.<br />
Names are big pieces of information.<br />
If we mention it in detail, that side will notice as well.<br />
Honey: Are they someone related to dungeons? Water Droplet: That is right! The dungeons slowly increasing and becoming stronger is widening a type of influence.<br />
But, you do not have to worry.<br />
Honey just needs to do exactly one thing.<br />
Honey: You must be talking about raising S-Ranks.<br />
That was the only thing those people had directly demanded.<br />
Tree: Correct this time again! Specifically, you just have to apply the keyword and gather exactly 50.<br />
com Water Droplet: More than that is fine too.<br />
Newcomer: If you just do that, you can leave the rest to us! Water Droplet: We cannot explain in detail.<br />
But please believe us.<br />
It is completely filling up 50 people in the skill window.<br />
You just have to do that.<br />
Was it really okay with just 50? Then again, if I applied the keyword and kept on putting on the growth buff, they would get much stronger than normal S-Ranks.<br />
According to how they grew, couldn’t an SS-Rank somehow appear too? Honey: Then can’t you change the keyword to a bit easier one? To something like my previous ‘do your best’.<br />
Water Droplet: The keyword is not something we set up.<br />
We check Honey’s skills and write down the names and explanations matching that.<br />
Deer: I named all the Perfect Caregiver title’s skills! Aren’t they perfect?Advertisements So you were the culprit.<br />
com for a better experience Honey: No, not at all.<br />
Then can’t you write the explanations more detailedly at least? Water Droplet: Oh that, Honey.<br />
There are two reasons.<br />
The first is that even we do not know people’s skills, abilities in detail.<br />
It is exactly at the level of discovering a new type of rabbit, examining it, and saying ‘this has long ears and jumps around and eats grass so let’s say it’s a rabbit’.<br />
We do not have the ability nor the time to thoroughly investigate them.<br />
Tree: Thankfully, there’s already collected data, so we’re more or less managing the skill windows, but cases like Honey’s is really an exception.<br />
Water Droplet: Yes, this is the first time the Perfect Caregiver title came out.<br />
Deer: Really □□□□□! Wolf: □□□□□□□□□!! Water Droplet: Drag those two guys out right now! [We apologize that the chat cannot be chosen at this time.<br />
It seemed like Water Droplet-ssi has a lot of hardships.<br />

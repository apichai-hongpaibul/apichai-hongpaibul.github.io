<p>Editor: Imagine
(Note from Imagine: Sorry For the late post you guys, Enjoy!)
The winter plum withered and the snow plum bloomed… then as time passed the snow plum withered and was once again replaced by one of winter A year had passed since Ju Seo Cheon started to live in the Lotus Peak.</p>
<p>Time flowed by really quickly.</p>
<p>He had practiced the Plum Blossom Life Arts everyday until now.
 Thanks to that, he accumulated forty five years worth of internal energy when he was eleven years old.</p>
<p>The Purple Haze Arts also reached the third start.
 It was still a disgustingly slow pace.
 This wasnt something Ju Seo Cheon controlled on purpose.
 It was the contrary.
 He trained by spending quite a lot of concentration.</p>
<p>Martial artists dont take too much time on completing an art if they focus on it.
 Generally one year was enough.</p>
<p>Actually he had already completed the Five Elements Plum Blossom Sword Art.
 It only took a few months for the basic swordsmanship like the Universe Sword Art and the Withered Flower Sword Art.</p>
<p>But of course, he had hidden these achievements so as to not attract any attention.</p>
<p>Whew.</p>
<p>Even though he could solve most of the things he achieved in the past due to the fact he had reached the unrestrained realm but the Purple Haze Arts was hard to comprehend even with prior experience in using it.</p>
<p>He realized that it wasnt a godly art of Mount Hua for nothing.</p>
<p>It would have been much faster if someone had taught him but he couldnt ask anyone for advice on the Purple Haze Arts so he had to solve it alone.</p>
<p>It wasnt that the fourth generation disciples tried to spend their childhood in the Lotus Peak for nothing.
 It meant that the treatment was that good.</p>
<p>The part Ju Seo Cheon liked especially was the close to free personal training.
 There were almost no restrictions to it.</p>
<p>He had learned some top ranked martial arts since having come to the Lotus Peak.</p>
<p>For the internal energy circulation, it was the Universal Plum Blossom Breathing Technique.</p>
<p>The internal energy circulation method that represented Mount Hua Sect were divided in four.</p>
<p>The first was the Plum Blossom Qi Arts that served as the base for everything.
 The second was the Universal Plum Blossom Breathing Technique and the third being the Jade Maidens Breathing Technique.</p>
<p>The Universal Plum Blossom Breathing Technique and the Jade Maidens Breathing Technique were only allowed to the full fledged disciples and the reason for that was that they served as the roots and trunks for Mount Hua Sect.</p>
<p>In addition, the Jade Maidens Breathing Technique was an energy circulation technique that was only made for women.
 Men werent able to learn it.</p>
<p>The fourth one was the Purple Haze Arts.
 It was the greatest art of Mount Hua Sect.</p>
<p>Ju Seo Cheon trained in the Plum Blossom Breathing Technique and also in the Plum Blossom Life Arts.</p>
<p>The two techniques were things he had practiced to the point he got tired of it in his past life so he was able to complete it at a really fast speed.</p>
<p>Besides that he learned the Fourteen Stances of the Plum Blossom Sword, pursuing arts, detoxification and other miscellaneous arts he would need in Kang Ho besides martial arts.
 The fourth generation disciples that had passed the evaluation received education of another level, as if to prove that this place wasnt called the Lotus Peak for nothing.</p>
<p>Ju Seo Cheon showed the Fourteen Stances of the Plum Blossom Sword to the instructor at a suitable level and took some time for personal training.</p>
<p>He spent most of his time sitting near the plum tree and operating the Plum Blossom Life Arts.
 Doing this regularly helped in accumulating internal energy.</p>
<p>Senior Brother.</p>
<p>After he finished circulating internal energy, he opened his eyes and saw a familiar face.</p>
<p>Ju Seo Cheon calmed down his surprised heart and said,
I will really get my internal energy run rampant and my insides will get screwed like this.</p>
<p>The two of them entered the Lotus Peak side by side a year ago.
 Because of that, the repercussions it brought still reverberated until now.</p>
<p>Im really sorry if I surprised you.</p>
<p>Nak Seo Wol blinked and then apologized.
 Those werent empty words and you could feel that she was really sorry from her voice.</p>
<p>Theres no need to apologize like that.
 Moreover, isnt it obvious you dont have to apologize as you are the granddaughter of that old ha…no, that grandma.
 Nak Seo Wol was ten years old.</p>
<p>Her mature mind and actions that didnt fit her age was still the same.
 She was considerate and conceded to others.
 In addition she received advice from her fellow comrades that were several times older than her.</p>
<p>That wasnt something that should be seen from a ten year old kid at all.</p>
<p>Part of it was because Nak Seo Wol wasnt normal since she was young but also because of the strict education she received from the Iron Plum Sword.</p>
<p>Senior brother.
 Nak Seo Wols cheeks swelled up.</p>
<p>Okay, I understand.
 Im sorry.
 I apologize.
 Ju Seo Cheon shrugged his shoulders and recognized his mistake.</p>
<p>The Iron Plum Sword may seem like a bloodless person but that wasnt the case for her disciple.</p>
<p>Nak Seo Wol got satisfied as Ju Seo Cheon apologized sincerely.</p>
<p>I think that it is really good for someone to admit their mistakes.
 Right.
 Before that, you are also quite the person to want to hang out with the likes of me.</p>
<p>Ju Seo Cheon received a nickname even before he made an appearance in Kang Ho.</p>
<p>The flashy and frail one.</p>
<p>It was taken from the idiom that he was externally splendid but didnt have anything inside of him.</p>
<p>A year ago, at the examination, Ju Seo Cheon had won by swinging his sword ignorantly.</p>
<p>At first people said that he may have used some black magic but it was resolved as Ju Seo Cheon had stumbled upon the fate of having consumed a miraculous medicine.
 A pig is wearing a pearl.
 Ugh, how did that fate go to that guy? It means that he is only lucky.</p>
<p>The evaluation of Ju Seo Cheon decreased even more.</p>
<p>Miraculous medicine.
 Having won simply with internal energy meant that his own martial prowess was terrible.</p>
<p>In the position of the disciples that had worked hard for several years, they couldnt help but resent Ju Seo Cheon more than their fated enemies.</p>
<p>Whatever the case, contrary to the idiom that supported his nickname of ‘The flashy and frail one, he had flashy internal energy and terrible martial arts.</p>
<p>It was obvious but Ju Seo Cheon didnt care about that at all.
 To the contrary, he was quite satisfied with having this nickname.</p>
<p>‘It annoys me that Im being cursed at but it makes sense.</p>
<p>He had entered the Lotus Peak but he was recognized as being plain.</p>
<p>This way he would be able to evade the gazes of the enemies that would appear in the future.</p>
<p>He regretted the way he had lived his past life and wanted to live the current one as he pleased but he had to, at least for now, keep a low profile.</p>
<p>You know what, senior brother.
 Nak Seo Wol stared at Ju Seo Cheon.</p>
<p>What? What you usually show is your original ability? Right.</p>
<p>Ju Seo Cheon laid a plate of steel in his face and lied.</p>
<p>Ju Seo Cheons actions, after entering the Lotus Peak, were exceptional in various meanings, and he received attention and expectations.</p>
<p>The moment he just entered, most people didnt see him in a good way.
 But there were some that didnt.</p>
<p>They thought that he may change if he was taught properly, even if he had passed the evaluation luckily with the help of a miraculous medicine.</p>
<p>A few instructors in the Lotus Peak especially thought that way.</p>
<p>They taught him on behalf of Yu Jong Mok, that had gone out on a mission, and taught him quite seriously even though he wasnt their disciple.</p>
<p>But there was no way that Ju Seo Cheon would follow their expectations as he had to hide his original skills.
 He only showed moderate skills.</p>
<p>And you know that elder Shim Ok Ryeon hates me.
 Thats why it would be better not to approach me.
 Ju Seo Cheon stood up from his seat.
 Nak Seo Wol wanted to follow him but he raised his hand and stopped her.</p>
<p>‘Ugh, what a waste.</p>
<p>He acted cool and uninterested in the outside but he wanted to return immediately and speak with Nak Seo Wol.</p>
<p>The memories from when he first saw her remained strongly deep in his heart.</p>
<p>She was standing at the latter levels of Murims Righteous Faction, was called as the Plum Blossom Sword peak and was courted by countless men.</p>
<p>Their difference in skills and prestige was so big that Ju Seo Cheon only followed her back.
 He didnt have the courage to speak to her.</p>
<p>That kind of person accompanied him, called out his name, smiled and held conversations together.
 It was enough to make him extremely happy.
 Nak Seo Wol became one of the peerless beauties of Murim and at the same time surged up like a hero.</p>
<p>Ju Seo Cheon, was nothing, only being able to admire his idols and doing so until his death.
 Nak Seo Wol was clearly among them.</p>
<p>Endure it a little bit more Ju Seo Cheon.</p>
<p>But the problem was Shim Ok Ryeon.</p>
<p>Not too much time passed since having entered the Lotus Peak, Shim Ok Ryeon showed on purpose that she didnt like Ju Seo Cheon and was wary of him.</p>
<p>But after some time passed she discovered that Ju Seo Cheon didnt commit any accidents, nor did he have any exceptional skills and stayed silent for the most part, so she naturally put away her interest.</p>
<p>This was the time when he should be patient.</p>
<p>Ju Seo Cheon reminded himself of that point several times.</p>
<p>The geniuses, talents and prodigies gathered at the Lotus Peak.
 There were nine members excluding Ju Seo Cheon.</p>
<p>When Ju Seo Cheon first saw the members of the Lotus Peak, he couldnt hide his surprise even though he had known who it would be.</p>
<p>That was because the current composition of the members was formed by people that mostly stood next to Nak Seo Wol on the battlefield.</p>
<p>If you thought about it, it was an obvious thing.</p>
<p>The Lotus Peak was a place where all the talents of Mount Hua Sect gathered at and were taken care of and nurtured to become exceptional If a person was particularly talented they were also provided with a top ranked martial arts or miraculous medicine.</p>
<p>Imagining of aparting their future.
 A ninth of the Plum Blossom Sword Examiners, elders and leaders were graduates from the Lotus Peak.</p>
<p>‘How should I express what im feeling right now?
They were all people he didnt have a connection with.
 They all lived in a completely different world.</p>
<p>These people didnt know the face or name of Ju Seo Cheon.</p>
<p>That was the same even when he became an elder in his past life.</p>
<p>‘Everyone that is here…will disappear during the age of war.</p>
<p>The age of war that continued for dozens of years.
 The force of Mount Hua Sect changed several times in that time.
 Starting from the Examiners, the Five Elders, and even the leader of the sect had changed due to the war.
 The ones that were called heroes lost their lives in exchange for peace.
 His fellow disciples were no exception.
 ‘No, now I also dont know when I will depart.</p>
<p>The reason Ju Seo Cheon was able to stay alive until the end in his past life was because of a bit of luck and part of his partial prowess.</p>
<p>Most of the ones that were called as elites were sent on important missions and got designated as targets to assassinate.</p>
<p>Most of the third and second ranked martial artists got deployed in the battlefield and disappeared.</p>
<p>On the other hand, martial artists with a moderate level somehow protected their lives and succeeded in staying alive.</p>
<p>But Ju Seo Cheon in this time surpassed that moderate level and entered the Lotus Peak, which was a class for geniuses, so he didnt know what would happen.</p>
<p>‘Will I be able to become a hero that others would admire as well?
Just as he thought that, a voice had called out to him
Hey, frail guy!
There was a really angry kid standing there.
 His eyes were fierce and he was breathing quite aggressively in an excited state.</p>
<p>His hip bone was much bigger than the other kids and his spiky hair was quite memorable.</p>
<p>Yes, brother Lee Geon.</p>
<p>Lee Geon was three years older than him, a member of the Lotus Peak that would turn fourteen this year.</p>
<p>You bastard!
Lee Geon glared at Ju Seo Cheon with bloodshot eyes.
 The emotions that flared from those eyes was clearly jealousy.
 Ju Seo Cheon scratched his head as if it was troublesome and Lee Geon glared at him while walking towards him.</p>
<p>He then grabbed his collarbone roughly with his hands that were quite frail.</p>
<p>You dare ignore what this senior brother of yours said? Im sure I warned you not to approach Nak last time.
 But you still dare speak to her even though you know that! </p>

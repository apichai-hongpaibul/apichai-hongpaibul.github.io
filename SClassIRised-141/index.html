<p>Chapter 136 Part 2 I should not have called this person.<br />
Little brother, this time, you made a wrong decision.<br />
But he would not have told me to call Hyunjae Sung if he knew that my fear resistance skill level decreased.<br />
I should have told him.  </p>
<p>How did Yoohyun Han come here.<br />
You probably have not heard the news, but the Hayeon Guild leader went to conquer a dungeon.<br />
The fire was merely a gas explosion since someone seemed to have escaped after forgetting to close a gas valve.<br />
Your tongue seems to be light as a feather.<br />
While Hyunjae Sung was still smiling, I had to wonder where the end of his patience was since he was not a guy used to holding back.<br />
However, I could not answer any of the questions.<br />
I could not tell him Taewon Song’s skill, and I would be crazy to tell him Yoohyun’s.<br />
It was the same for the magic stone in my chest.<br />
Hyunjae Sung spoke as he stared at me after a short silence.  </p>
<p>It can’t be helped.<br />
My knees bent not out of my own accord.<br />
My breath hitched, and everything turned white.<br />
When my shaking vision somehow cleared, I could see my hands on the floor.<br />
The sound of my breathing seemed too far away to be mine.  </p>
<p>Yoojin Han.<br />
com Hyunjae Sung lowered his body with one knee on the ground.<br />
He tousled my head like a dog and made me lift my head.<br />
Our eyes met while I was still reeling, and his gaze that pretended to be gentle instilled a deep fear in me.  </p>
<p>Yoojin, you should be telling me the truth.<br />
His sweet whisper came like an absolute command.<br />
The ends of my fingers clawed the floor.  </p>
<p>Why were you wounded on the chest.<br />
The magic stone…The magic stone of Diarma.<br />
My head cleared a bit once I remembered it.<br />
Diarma and the Queen of the Mermen.<br />
I remembered what happened at that time.<br />
A cursed poisonous dragon large enough to swallow a star and the ruler of waters.<br />
Damn it, I had gone through almost anything despite being an F class.<br />
I would not bend to this.<br />
While I had lost the benefits of the fear resistance skill, I still had my experiences under my belt.  </p>
<p>My opponent is only an S class.<br />
com I clenched my teeth.<br />
I tried to escape from the chains choking me, but it was not easy.<br />
In fiction, people would somehow break free by sheer will, but reality was bleak.  </p>
<p>Stop resisting and speak.<br />
Then you would be released.<br />
It was a tempting offer.<br />
I could not do anything about the class difference and therefore had no way out.<br />
My stats were F class and there was a huge gap between Hyunjae Sung and me, and I had no mental resistance items.<br />
F class was useless.<br />
Therefore, only an even higher class could win against a higher class.  </p>
<p>That bastard.<br />
I used magic through breath-taking pressure.<br />
The mental skill of the Diarma was not directed at him.<br />
I could not use it, and it would not be effective unless he accepted it due to class differences.<br />
The skill was addressed to me.<br />
I took only some parts of the skill effects and refreshed my memory of when Diarma and the Queen faced each other and their immense presence.<br />
An S class? That was a pond in front of an ocean.<br />
com The ocean attacked the pond and me and swept us away.  </p>
<p>Uh!Damn, I had to be crazy.<br />
I should have chosen Diarma before he became a dragon.<br />
I stopped breathing for a moment.<br />
I slid down on the ground and looked up at Hyunjae Sung with tears streaking down my face.<br />
He looked actually surprised now.  </p>
<p>You’re only an S class.<br />
You don’t deserve to see this.<br />
Why are you smiling? Hyunjae Sung picked me up again, and I felt absolutely battered inside.<br />
I wanted my pet.<br />
Hey, your daddy is dying right now.<br />
-Peep!.<br />
…Hey.<br />
It really came.<br />
I gently took the baby bird floating in front of me in my hands.<br />
The soft and warm touch calmed my racing heartbeat.  </p>
<p>So, it does have a teleport skill.<br />
Stop looking at someone else’s pet.<br />
-Peep.<br />
Peep!.<br />
Hey, thank you for coming to me, but it’s too dangerous for you to be out like this.<br />
It would be difficult for me if the little guy appeared during a battle.<br />
I should educate him so he would not teleport so easily, but I had no idea how to do it.<br />
The car arrived as I fed the little guy magic stones.<br />
The driver immediately came out and opened the back door.<br />
I wanted to fall asleep the moment I sat but I glared at Hyunjae Sung, who sat next to me instead.  </p>
<p>If you have a conscience, please get off.<br />
We will be immediately returning to the guild.<br />
Hyunjae Sung ignored my words and spoke to the driver.<br />
Wait, that guild would not mean Haeyeon?.<br />
I can’t leave you like this.<br />
I’ll protect you for the foreseeable future.<br />
You’re the most dangerous person I know!-Peep!.<br />
Thank you for overestimating an S class.<br />
Please let me out anywhere near a lane.<br />
I did not know whether I could walk, but I would return home if I needed to crawl.<br />
Or if someone would just let me make a phone call to Haeyeon.  </p>
<p>I’m unwell, but I just need to stay at home.<br />
Do you have the right to be worried about me.<br />
I’ll erase a debt.<br />
Two.<br />
Let’s bury the hatchet about Noah.<br />
com for a better experience.<br />
You ask too much for a lowly S class.<br />
Hyunjae Sung’s face creased into a sad face, and I did not care, two debts had to be paid.<br />
He seemed to know his crimes as he accepted the deal soon enough.<br />
The car, fortunately, turned to the raising area.<br />
Noah was waiting anxiously at the parking lot.  </p>
<p>Mr.<br />
Yoojin!Noah rushed towards me and held my arm.<br />
He then glared at Hyunjae Sung.  </p>
<p>Why does he look worse than before.<br />
He did too much as he always does.<br />
Let him rest.<br />
Did he know whose fault it was? Hyunjae Sung looked at my chest before getting back in the car.  </p>
<p>I’m curious avout what you are going to say to your little brother.<br />
com for the best novel reading experience.<br />
Hey, what? Are you going to tell him?!The bastard disappeared into the car without a reply.<br />
What excuse should I make? I was thinking of getting fake skin to hide the wound as I still had a few days before Yoohyun came out.<br />
<em> * </em>.<br />
Are you alright?My little brother appeared as soon as I washed up after arriving at home.<br />
Irin had become tangible from the tattoo and sat perched on my shoulder to look alternatively at Yoohyun and me.<br />
Well, little brother, you seemed to have used a gate stone.  </p>

<p>&lt; Noonim Is a Little… (2) .<br />
To go out to the rooftop garden, you had to take an elevator up after going down to the 1st floor.<br />
It was a pity, but I couldn’t go out directly from my house.<br />
Also, I had to contact the security room ahead of time, when going on a walk in the garden.<br />
It was because, that way, they could focus surveillance on the rooftop garden from the building.<br />
My privacy was, well, let’s just be satisfied with no security cameras in the house.<br />
…There weren’t any, right? ‘The sunlight hurts……’ As soon as I came out of the elevator, the bright summer sun pierced my tired eyes.<br />
I had heard that the garden was well decorated, but I couldn’t see it properly.<br />
‘Stamina potion… the dungeon with the materials quickly……’ There was still a lot of time left until it would come out originally, but the speed of the frequency of dungeons appearing had increased, so please come out before I die of overwork.<br />
Should I meet the system people and beg them to make it come out immediately? I played with Comet, who was awake in the middle of the night, for about an hour and fed it, and then I went back to sleep.<br />
And then I woke up again one hour later.<br />
Then I played with it for one hour and went back to sleep, and thirty minutes later I woke up to it cheeping, and it fussed for about ten minutes and I went back to sleep, and then I woke up again, slept, woke up…… It repeated until 8 in the morning before it stopped.<br />
com for the best novel reading experience Exactly one hour after shoving my head into my bed, at exactly 9 in the morning when Blue started to cry loudly, I felt like I really would die.<br />
‘Peace was really an angel……’ Of course Chirpie, and even Blue, were well-behaved if it was to this extent.<br />
They let me sleep.<br />
To think it was regularly sleeping at nine and getting up at nine.<br />
They didn’t fuss about sleeping at all; they really were good kids.<br />
-Kkyaaoo! Blue let out a happy shout and shot up to the sky.<br />
The sight of the cream-colored gryphon crossing through the bright blue sky was blinding.<br />
It was praiseworthy that even while flying around excitedly, she checked my position and didn’t go past a certain distance.<br />
And Chirpie, who was in my arms, might’ve been excited after seeing the garden, because it was flapping its wings.<br />
Seeing how it didn’t try to immediately jump down, it was smart Chirpie.  </p>
<p>Here, you go and play, too.<br />
-Chirp! When I lowered it down inside a flowerbed, it rooted through the bright green grass with its feet and then grabbed it with its beak and pulled.<br />
Don’t eat it.<br />
It was a place where the kids would play, so I told them not to spray insecticide but still, they couldn’t eat just anything.<br />
As soon as I saw a bench while I was walking, following Chirpie, I sat down.<br />
Maybe this was also expensive, because even though it was a bench, it was comfortable.<br />
Should I sleep a little? ‘I have to train Blue, too.<br />
’ The keyword was applied right before I went into the A-Rank dungeon, so I couldn’t use the My Brat skill yet.<br />
I should quickly raise her at least, so that it would be less troublesome… It would be less troublesome, right? She wouldn’t be like that after growing up, right? -Kkyaoo! Kkya kkya! When I saw Blue stripping a magnificent garden tree bare, my mind went blank.<br />
She’ll be well-behaved once she grows…… ‘I have to bring in the people expected to Awaken with special skills, too.<br />
I should quickly set up a system so I can leave at least the people to other people; it’s really a heavy workload.<br />
’ In that chaos, even a phone call came.<br />
As time went on, so much contact from anybody and everybody came, so in the end, I got another phone, but there weren’t a lot of people who knew this phone number.<br />
com ‘So it’s Riette’s brother.<br />
’ It was the number that I had gotten from Riette and saved.<br />
I had heard that he would be coming today, but it was earlier than expected.<br />
Was he going to come secretly like his noona? Though he wouldn’t be able to pass through the mini portal.<br />
When I took the call, a voice that was polite but very young came out.<br />
[This is the Ark Guild Leader Noah Luire[1.<br />
Is this Hunter Han Yoojin? …Guild Leader? Noah Luire? Not Faible[2?.<br />
I am, but was this not Riette-ssi’s younger brother’s contact information?[Yes.<br />
I am the younger brother.<br />
To think he was the younger brother – that was a little weird.<br />
They had gone into an illegal dungeon alone together, so I had thought they definitely weren’t affiliated to a guild.<br />
But he was a guild leader, and on top of that, it wasn’t a name I heard from Riette.<br />
Though I thought Riette also used a different name outwardly.<br />
‘Ark’s Noah Luire.<br />
com I didn’t remember all of the overseas guilds and Hunters.<br />
First of all, I was sure he wasn’t within the top 30 in Hunter rankings before the regression.<br />
Though it would become different now that he had gotten the Dio Valshesis along with his noona.  </p>
<p>It is a little different from what I heard.<br />
The name as well.<br />
[Yes.<br />
Noonim… would have called me ‘faible’.<br />
So he really was her younger brother.  </p>
<p>I did not know you were a guild leader.<br />
Riette-ssi did not mention it.<br />
[Noonim does not particularly like guilds as a whole.<br />
There are many guilds she has a terrible relationship with.<br />
So she does not stay in one place, and goes looking for illegal dungeons here and there around the world.<br />
If it seems like her strength would not be enough, she also contacts me.<br />
It is frequently difficult, since she drags me along without thinking of my schedule.<br />
The voice speaking was bitter.<br />
So he suffered a lot because of his noona, huh.<br />
[There are places she fought with among Korea’s guilds, so I would be thankful if you treated me as Ark’s Guild Leader who has no relation with noonim.  </p>
<p>Of course I will.<br />
com Just looking at her recklessness in trespassing into a giant guild’s dorm room, I thought there must be quite a lot of guilds that hated Riette.<br />
Even if she was an S-Rank Hunter, was it okay for her to live however she wanted like that? Noah requested for me to formally invite him.<br />
He had gotten the agreement from the Hunter Association, MKC, and Hanshin, but without a reply from the other three guilds, he said he needed my invitation in order to formally visit the rearing facility.<br />
Haeyeon and Breaker had the guild leaders gone, but why didn’t Seseong give a reply? After relaying it to the Association side, we agreed on a meeting in the afternoon.<br />
I left Blue to the rearing room and in the meantime, closed my eyes for a bit.<br />
Yerim stared at me with lukewarm eyes.  </p>
<p>Ahjussi, really……’ Since she was glaring quietly at my neck, I gave a sigh.<br />
This was definitely.<br />
‘Kang Soyoung-ssi didn’t seem like it, but her lips are loose.<br />
’ It was obvious she had told.<br />
How far did it spread?.<br />
Today, I’m going to stay with you.<br />
I took my classes in the morning.<br />
com for the best novel reading experience.<br />
It shouldn’t be enough with just the morning classes, though.<br />
Ah, then I can just make up for it in the evening.<br />
Anyways, please don’t think of meeting anybody by yourself.<br />
…Don’t put out a civil complaint.<br />
It really wasn’t with a bad intention.<br />
Yerim’s gaze hurt.<br />
Chief Song should be fine, right? It definitely should have reached Sung Hyunjae’s ears, but I didn’t know if he would use that as a pretext to be bothersome.<br />
If you broke his car, then that was enough.<br />
Noah Luire arrived a little earlier than the appointment time.<br />
Unlike Riette, he was a beautiful young man with bright blond hair and metallic light gray eyes.<br />
The Lauchtas’ Natural Enemy skill’s message window appeared and then disappeared.<br />
I thought that those eyes were probably affected by the Dio Valshesis title.<br />
Seeing how the hair colors were completely contrary to each other, wouldn’t it be that they were affected by the twin dragons’ color scheme?.<br />
Thank you for giving permission to visit.<br />
It is an honor to meet you like this.<br />
Noah greeted me incredibly respectfully.<br />
To think that an S-Rank Hunter was this normal and courteous, it was surprising.<br />
Though Song Taewon was also on the polite side.  </p>
<p>You must have had a hard time coming such a long way.<br />
com This was the security room’s demand.<br />
Rather than indoors, outdoors was better to surveil and in a possible scenario, they could respond quickly.<br />
Sound wasn’t heard and actions could be verified, so it was perfect for a request that required maintaining a secret.  </p>
<p>Hunter Bak Yerim is supposed to sit with us – is that alright?At my question, Noah nodded his head.  </p>
<p>I just need to take off my translation item.<br />
Hunter Bak Yerim-nim, are you possibly proficient in English or French.<br />
Only a tiny bit in English.<br />
Yerim said, showing her thumb and index finger placed apart slightly.<br />
There shouldn’t be a problem.<br />
Still, it would be better to not say Riette’s name as much as possible.  </p>
<p>First, I would like to apologize for the disrespect committed by noonim.<br />
I did not hear in detail, but she definitely must have acted obstinately.<br />
As soon as we sat at a table on one side of the garden, Noah slightly lowered his head.<br />
He knew well.<br />
How did such a reliable younger brother appear from under that kind of noona? Was it because it was that kind of noona?.<br />
It was not that bad of a meeting.<br />
Thanks to that, I was able to meet Noah-ssi like this as well.<br />
com for the best novel reading experience Thanks to the skill effect doubled, up to applying the keyword to an S-Rank Hunter with an SSS-Rank title, was easy.<br />
It was a pity he was a guild leader, but how good was it to add even just one S-Rank with nothing? Should I have just applied the keyword to Riette at that time, too? ‘Since he’s apparently a good younger brother who listens well, it’s even better.<br />
’ Just in case, I had checked the two’s relationship.<br />
Like Riette’s assurance, he seemed polite with a good personality.<br />
Wasn’t this having the chance to say the keyword laid out for me?.<br />
It seems like Noah-ssi instead must have had many troubles.<br />
Isn’t coming all the way here also on your noonim’s request.<br />
It is not just that.<br />
I cannot tell you the specifics, but I am planning on staying in Korea for the time being.<br />
Did he have other things to do? I wanted to check Noah’s status window, but I didn’t know if Riette had told him about my skill or not.<br />
First of all, he said he didn’t hear in detail, but did she keep it a secret from her brother too? If she did, she was trustable, unlike her attitude.  </p>
<p>I have heard from your noonim that there is a monster she wishes to entrust to me.<br />
Yes.<br />
Though I could not bring it along.<br />
It is scheduled so that it will be able to be brought over by plane, instead of by boat.<br />
Apparently the condition is using a private plane, or possibly a chartered plane, that is accompanied by a preferentially S-Rank Hunter, and that will gradually be eased up.<br />
Then it seems like S-Rank Hunters would deign to directly come for monster rearing commissions from overseas, for a long while.<br />
I would be able to see famous faces while sitting there quietly.<br />
com for the best novel reading experience.<br />
Of course, if I can find one as well, I would like to request the kiseungsu rearing.<br />
Noah said, smiling softly.<br />
He was quite amiable.<br />
It would be great if the other S-Ranks were like this from now on.  </p>
<p>It is welcome any time.<br />
While you have come here, please check the facility as well before you go.<br />
Ah, could I possibly hear where you will be staying?If I couldn’t apply the keyword today, I should go looking for him.  </p>
<p>First, I came alone, so it has not been decided yet.<br />
There are many lodgings.<br />
Thank you for your care.<br />
You are welcome.<br />
Noah-ssi, is also my loving client.<br />
Would it work with once or not? Before that, he had two names, so could I use whichever one? I was looking for Noah’s reaction, but confusingly, Yerim poked my arm.  </p>
<p>Doesn’t ahjussi say ‘love’ too lightly and whenever? You were like that to the Seseong Guild Leader, too.<br />
It’s just business.<br />
Still, I don’t like it.<br />
Oho, I should refrain from applying the keyword in front of Yerim.<br />
I did say it often in front of her lately.  </p>
<p>Okay.<br />
But don’t they say it casually in the West? I think I’ve seen it a lot as a greeting or an exclamation.<br />
So even if I say ‘I love you, Noah-ssi’, he might not feel anything in particular.<br />
…Is that so?I also didn’t know.<br />
Anyways, it seemed like I couldn’t say the keyword more, so I should meet him separately later when Yerim wasn’t here.<br />
While thinking that, I turned to look at Noah, but the atmosphere was a little weird.<br />
The gaze of the person who had been facing me with a smile was glued to the table.<br />
The expression was stiff.  </p>
<p>…Noah-ssi?It didn’t seem like a reaction of the keyword being applied.<br />
com The table edge that Noah’s hand was touching was crushed.<br />
Yerim got up from her seat first, and I also lifted up my body following her.<br />
The silver gray eyes were still starting at the table.<br />
I heard him mumble very quietly.  </p>
<p>…Weaker than me.<br />
What nonsense-.  </p>
<p>Ahjussi!Yerim’s hand grabbed my arm and pulled me back.<br />
At nearly the same time, Kwadeuk! The table broke and my chest burned.  </p>
<p>com My body, which was thrown back strongly, rolled about two times on the ground and stopped.<br />
Without even the time to think about what was going on, I felt a powerful pain in my chest while I was trying to raise my body, and collapsed.<br />
I saw blood that was sprayed on the ground.<br />
Potion, no before that- I used the Teacher skill towards Yerim.  </p>
<p>This crazy bastard!Kagang! The Ice Wood Spear blocked the attack.<br />
What hit it were long sharp claws.<br />
Yerim, who couldn’t win in strength, backed off with the instant movement.<br />
Kwadeudeu! Incredibly strong claws dug into that place.<br />
Dirt and grass shot up high and even the debris of the building’s ceiling bounced up.<br />
Shadowless Day was already spread out, and Sigh’s fog was surging above that.<br />
I could see Noah between the ferocious fog.<br />
The two eyes that had changed into those similar to a reptile’s, a beast’s claws, and one arm with gold scales.<br />
Above all, that face, that expression was distorted like a madman’s.<br />
Exactly what happened?.<br />
com I cursorily sprayed a potion on the wound and stood up.  </p>
<p>Ahjussi, stay there!”Advertisements I felt the chill that had formed even here, and, Swaaa-! Ice rain poured down toward Noah.<br />
But Noah swung his arms carelessly and blocked it as if breaking the attack.<br />
Shadowless Day’s restricting effect was in effect, but it only held Noah’s feet for a moment.<br />
Compared to him, Yerim was already covered in blood.<br />
No, it would be relief if she had only gotten wounds.<br />
The blood flowing out the large scratch on her left arm was black.<br />
It was poison.<br />
Shit, the difference in their levels really were big.<br />
On top of that, for Yerim to use all her combat power, I, without cold resistance, was in the way.  </p>
<p>Stop, Noah!I shouted cursorily, and took out Mental prioritized equipment from my inventory.<br />
…Uh.<br />
Huh?Taken aback, noises fell out of Yerim’s and my mouths at the same time.<br />
Noah really stopped? With his gaze dropped to the ground, he stepped back.<br />
On top of that, his body was shaking.<br />
I heard the soft mumbling through Yerim’s ears.  </p>
<p>…It’s okay, that’s weak.<br />
Weaker than me, it’s okay, I can kill it[3……’ I didn’t know exactly why he was saying something like that, but while there was a chance, I used the Seed-Leaf skill in order to check his initial skills at least.<br />
com Optimized Initial Skills Soundless Scream(S) Acquired Stat Rental(A) Acquired Healing Hand(B) Acquired …For a moment, I doubted my eyes.<br />
The possible Awakening stat rank was A.<br />
Not A~S, but A.<br />
Even if he had Awakened optimally, he should’ve been A-Rank, but his current stats were S-Rank.<br />
At most, he had grown into an S-Rank in 3 years.<br />
It definitely wasn’t a normal speed.<br />
Hurriedly, I checked the My Brat skill window, too.<br />
(Noah-S) The keyword really was applied.<br />
Noah’s reaction, the growth to stat S-Rank, Riette’s words that she raised her younger brother.<br />
And right now, he was thinking of me as his noona.<br />
……Crazy, what exactly did Riette do? [1 ok idk any french, so I had to go through last name sites online to try to find out what this was, and then paste them into google tl to hear what they sounded like alsdkjfas.<br />
‘Luire’ doesn’t seem like a last name, but I also went thru krn fan tweets to see what they thought it was, and one I found said that the transliteration (roo-hee-reu, krn doesn’t really have an ‘l’ sound except for in certain cases in the middle of a word) sounded similar and also it means ‘to shine’ which… suits him? Because he’s gold? [2 tbh I thought that this was ‘pebble’ at first (there’s no f sound in krn either), but the namu wiki pg for the novel kindly told me that what Riette calls her younger brother is the french word ‘faible’.<br />
If you don’t know french, i don’t think you have to look it up, bc it might be explained later on as we learn more about Noah &amp; his relationship w his sister.<br />
Or it might not, bc idk how namu wiki knew that it was ‘faible’; maybe it was defined in the novel later on, or maybe it was from an author’s note.<br />
Anyways yj doesn’t seem to know what it ismeans, either, but we’ll get the gist of it at least as the story develops [3 noah is probably talking abt a person (rietteyj), but while this sentence doesn’t have a direct object (as in it’s often omitted in krn when implied in the context), he says ‘that’ in the prev sent, indicating a thing, not a person, so I wrote it as ‘it’ here, too.  </p>

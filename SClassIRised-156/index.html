<p>143 Part 2 He was at his prime, and there would not be much trouble if they merged.</p>
<p>Then, I’ll be leaving.
Have fun.
Let go of my wrist and let me leave.
However, Mr.
Young Shards did not let me go but actually pulled me in.
If he only had a few memories before the return, I might win.
However, another part of me whispered that I would find myself in the afterlife.</p>
<p>You’re heartless.
You tied me up with a chain and dumped me in water the first time we met.
I would lose any affection I had for you before.
I dragged you out, dried you, and changed you.
And I also accepted you inside me.
That was to save you-</p>
<p>That was not me, Yoojin Han.
He was right, and the eyes that bent down to me looked foreboding.
Hyunjae Sung seemed to be in a foul mood.
Well, if he were at the brink of being swallowed whole, even Hyunjae Sung would not be confident, and he was younger mentally.</p>
<p>Should I apologize?
Give me something else instead.
Like what?
My body.
I’m sorry, but that’s impossible.
Play rock, paper, and scissors between the two of you.
I can be the judge.
It would be fun to watch, while the current Hyunjae Sung would win in all probability.
The shard smiled at my words.</p>
<p>It’s impossible for me to take my current body.
However-
The end of his finger gently tapped my chest, and he traced my wound hidden under clothing with it.</p>
<p>You have something that can replace it.
What? Wait.
It’s a combination of an SS class magic stone and a cracked one that’s at least an L class.
That’s nice.
I can’t give this to you even if you give the entire Sesung Guild!I would never be able to get the Diarma one.
What was only a shard who could not even pay thinking? 
The magic stone will not wake properly in the present situation.
Hyunjae Sung spoke with conviction.</p>
<p>How do you know that? You said you don’t remember.
I did not lose them all.
I remembered a bit about that foolish lizard.
Was he telling the truth? I was suspicious but had no way to confirm it.
However, the fact was that the combined magic stone did not respond after all this time.
com for the best novel reading experience 
So what? Would a Hyunjae Sung replica spring out if I give you this stone? That’s horrible! Damn!It was a sight that made me curse just by imagining it.
I really did not want it to happen, and it would be better to not open the wound and take out the stone.
One Hyunjae Sung was enough in my life.
While he would be useful, he was still a Hyunjae Sung.</p>
<p>You’ll hurt my feelings.
While I would like to be shifted like that, it’s impossible.
That was expected.
If it was possible…actually, there might be a way.
I shook my head to get rid of all foolish thoughts.</p>
<p>I would become a different person, something like a beast.
Then, just be swallowed now and here.
It’s not in me to give up so easily.
The face that smiled at me looked like the current Hyunjae Sung.
He was the same person.
I furrowed my brow for a moment and opened my mouth.</p>
<p>com for a better experience 
I’ll make sure of that.
Your problem is that the higher class magic stone is not whole.
Magic is faintly leaking out of it now.
Hyunjae Sung spoke that the beast would be complete in at least a month if he supplemented it.
While I was weary, I did not just want to lose these stones for nothing.
Also, while he was a shard which had no memories before the return, Hyunjae Sung was Hyunjae Sung, and there was a high possibility of the beast stats increasing.
Of course, what irritated me was that he was Hyunjae Sung.
I did not think for long, since I wanted as many cards as possible.</p>
<p>I’m in.
What should I do?
You only have to return there and take me with you.
I can move onto the stone by myself.
You won’t take my body for your use?
If it were possible, I would have asked you to find a stronger one.
I apologize for having a weak body, even though I thought I was above average.
com I turned off the skill with Hyunjae Sung’s shard.
I blanked out for a second before my eyes opened again.</p>
<p>Uhh…My vision was blurry.
I took out a mana potion, but I still could not see well.
My eyesight seemed to have decreased, and I hoped it was a temporary condition.
I also ached everywhere, and it took a few vitality potions to get on my feet.
The magic stone in my chest seemed to be the same.
‘I’m going to die.
’ I could not speak well, and as I woke up on a bed instead of a sofa, Hyunjae Sung seemed to have returned properly.
Then why couldn’t I see? The question was on the tip of my tongue when I heard the sound of water falling from far away.
I did not know what happened, but I immediately thought of that massive aquarium.
I stumbled out of the room, and Irin popped out from somewhere and led me after a glance.
It was Yoohyun, and there was no one else anyway.
I nearly fell from the stairs while I was following Irin.
There must be an elevator around somewhere.
I saw that the aquarium had disappeared, and the two drenched men as I stepped into the garden.
Yoohyun!
Hey, are you all right?Yoohyun looked back at me as he let go of Hyunjae Sung’s collar.
The ground became muddy because of the water, and cleaning would be hell.
Why did Hyunjae Sung have something like this in his house? There was a lovely floating garden right over there.</p>
<p>Why did you come in? You should have waited for a bit longer.
You’re dripping.
Shouldn’t you manage your household facilities better?
I managed to avoid a fire.
My brother seemed to have been a little agitated.
However, he had a reason to be.
Was not burning down the garden a bit trivial compared to what Hyunjae Sung did to me? I did not know whether Yoohyun knew that.</p>
<p>Anyway, Yoojin Han.
Hyunjae Sung suddenly lifted his fingers toward me.</p>
<p>Three.
I can distinguish that much, although things were a little blurry.</p>
<p>You’re wrong.
Yes? There are definitely three.
I grabbed Hyunjae Sung’s hand and pulled it close against me.
He was holding three fingers up.</p>
<p>Why are you lying?
Your vision is compromised since you had to pull me closer to check.
The clever snake spoke, and Yoohyun stared at me with surprised eyes.
Hyunjae Sung complicated things.</p>

<p>143 Part 2 He was at his prime, and there would not be much trouble if they merged.  </p>
<p>Then, I’ll be leaving.<br />
Have fun.<br />
Let go of my wrist and let me leave.<br />
However, Mr.<br />
Young Shards did not let me go but actually pulled me in.<br />
If he only had a few memories before the return, I might win.<br />
However, another part of me whispered that I would find myself in the afterlife.  </p>
<p>You’re heartless.<br />
You tied me up with a chain and dumped me in water the first time we met.<br />
I would lose any affection I had for you before.<br />
I dragged you out, dried you, and changed you.<br />
And I also accepted you inside me.<br />
That was to save you.  </p>
<p>That was not me, Yoojin Han.<br />
He was right, and the eyes that bent down to me looked foreboding.<br />
Hyunjae Sung seemed to be in a foul mood.<br />
Well, if he were at the brink of being swallowed whole, even Hyunjae Sung would not be confident, and he was younger mentally.  </p>
<p>Should I apologize.<br />
Give me something else instead.<br />
Like what.<br />
My body.<br />
I’m sorry, but that’s impossible.<br />
Play rock, paper, and scissors between the two of you.<br />
I can be the judge.<br />
It would be fun to watch, while the current Hyunjae Sung would win in all probability.<br />
The shard smiled at my words.  </p>
<p>It’s impossible for me to take my current body.<br />
However.<br />
The end of his finger gently tapped my chest, and he traced my wound hidden under clothing with it.  </p>
<p>You have something that can replace it.<br />
What? Wait.<br />
It’s a combination of an SS class magic stone and a cracked one that’s at least an L class.<br />
That’s nice.<br />
I can’t give this to you even if you give the entire Sesung Guild!I would never be able to get the Diarma one.<br />
What was only a shard who could not even pay thinking?.<br />
The magic stone will not wake properly in the present situation.<br />
Hyunjae Sung spoke with conviction.  </p>
<p>How do you know that? You said you don’t remember.<br />
I did not lose them all.<br />
I remembered a bit about that foolish lizard.<br />
Was he telling the truth? I was suspicious but had no way to confirm it.<br />
However, the fact was that the combined magic stone did not respond after all this time.<br />
com for the best novel reading experience.<br />
So what? Would a Hyunjae Sung replica spring out if I give you this stone? That’s horrible! Damn!It was a sight that made me curse just by imagining it.<br />
I really did not want it to happen, and it would be better to not open the wound and take out the stone.<br />
One Hyunjae Sung was enough in my life.<br />
While he would be useful, he was still a Hyunjae Sung.  </p>
<p>You’ll hurt my feelings.<br />
While I would like to be shifted like that, it’s impossible.<br />
That was expected.<br />
If it was possible…actually, there might be a way.<br />
I shook my head to get rid of all foolish thoughts.  </p>
<p>I would become a different person, something like a beast.<br />
Then, just be swallowed now and here.<br />
It’s not in me to give up so easily.<br />
The face that smiled at me looked like the current Hyunjae Sung.<br />
He was the same person.<br />
I furrowed my brow for a moment and opened my mouth.  </p>
<p>com for a better experience.<br />
I’ll make sure of that.<br />
Your problem is that the higher class magic stone is not whole.<br />
Magic is faintly leaking out of it now.<br />
Hyunjae Sung spoke that the beast would be complete in at least a month if he supplemented it.<br />
While I was weary, I did not just want to lose these stones for nothing.<br />
Also, while he was a shard which had no memories before the return, Hyunjae Sung was Hyunjae Sung, and there was a high possibility of the beast stats increasing.<br />
Of course, what irritated me was that he was Hyunjae Sung.<br />
I did not think for long, since I wanted as many cards as possible.  </p>
<p>I’m in.<br />
What should I do.<br />
You only have to return there and take me with you.<br />
I can move onto the stone by myself.<br />
You won’t take my body for your use.<br />
If it were possible, I would have asked you to find a stronger one.<br />
I apologize for having a weak body, even though I thought I was above average.<br />
com I turned off the skill with Hyunjae Sung’s shard.<br />
I blanked out for a second before my eyes opened again.  </p>
<p>Uhh…My vision was blurry.<br />
I took out a mana potion, but I still could not see well.<br />
My eyesight seemed to have decreased, and I hoped it was a temporary condition.<br />
I also ached everywhere, and it took a few vitality potions to get on my feet.<br />
The magic stone in my chest seemed to be the same.<br />
‘I’m going to die.<br />
’ I could not speak well, and as I woke up on a bed instead of a sofa, Hyunjae Sung seemed to have returned properly.<br />
Then why couldn’t I see? The question was on the tip of my tongue when I heard the sound of water falling from far away.<br />
I did not know what happened, but I immediately thought of that massive aquarium.<br />
I stumbled out of the room, and Irin popped out from somewhere and led me after a glance.<br />
It was Yoohyun, and there was no one else anyway.<br />
I nearly fell from the stairs while I was following Irin.<br />
There must be an elevator around somewhere.<br />
I saw that the aquarium had disappeared, and the two drenched men as I stepped into the garden.<br />
Yoohyun.<br />
Hey, are you all right?Yoohyun looked back at me as he let go of Hyunjae Sung’s collar.<br />
The ground became muddy because of the water, and cleaning would be hell.<br />
Why did Hyunjae Sung have something like this in his house? There was a lovely floating garden right over there.  </p>
<p>Why did you come in? You should have waited for a bit longer.<br />
You’re dripping.<br />
Shouldn’t you manage your household facilities better.<br />
I managed to avoid a fire.<br />
My brother seemed to have been a little agitated.<br />
However, he had a reason to be.<br />
Was not burning down the garden a bit trivial compared to what Hyunjae Sung did to me? I did not know whether Yoohyun knew that.  </p>
<p>Anyway, Yoojin Han.<br />
Hyunjae Sung suddenly lifted his fingers toward me.  </p>
<p>Three.<br />
I can distinguish that much, although things were a little blurry.  </p>
<p>You’re wrong.<br />
Yes? There are definitely three.<br />
I grabbed Hyunjae Sung’s hand and pulled it close against me.<br />
He was holding three fingers up.  </p>
<p>Why are you lying.<br />
Your vision is compromised since you had to pull me closer to check.<br />
The clever snake spoke, and Yoohyun stared at me with surprised eyes.<br />
Hyunjae Sung complicated things.  </p>

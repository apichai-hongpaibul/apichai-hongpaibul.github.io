<p>&lt; Cleaning Should Be Water Cleaning (1) .<br />
Han Yoojin had gone missing.<br />
The Haeyeon Guild Leader, who had gone to see his hyung as soon as it became visiting hours at 9am, was furious at the empty holding room.<br />
The Hunter in charge of the detention center, whose collar was grabbed by Han Yoohyun, explained while trembling that an order to move Han Yoojin had come down.<br />
But the whereabouts of the vehicle that took Han Yoojin and left the detention center became unknown.<br />
The Hunter Association was turned upside down and temporary checkpoints were put up here and there.<br />
Each portal site was plastered with related articles in an instant.<br />
An interview filled with the Haeyeon Guild Leader’s miserable feelings came up as breaking news.<br />
-The world’s sole magic beast trainer, Hunter Han Yoojin’s, whereabouts? -The possibility of having left Korea already is high -The tragedy brought about by the Hunter Association’s poor management system -The economic and social worth of the magic beast rearing skill The entire country started to chatter away even before reaching the afternoon.<br />
The broadcast that Han Yoojin had filmed in the past and the live broadcast video from a few days ago filled TV screens several times.<br />
There was a lot of talk that simply worried about the missing person, but the main public opinion was more focused on Han Yoojin’s worth.<br />
com The economic gain and the stability of dungeon management created from him raising magic beasts.<br />
How much foreign Hunters fretted over entrusting baby monsters to Han Yoojin.<br />
The anticipation from the earnings from abroad, etc.<br />
All sorts of media chattered without a break about how big of a loss Han Yoojin’s disappearance was to the country.<br />
And late afternoon.  </p>
<p>I should have protected ahjussi.<br />
I promised I would protect him……Having just come out of a dungeon and belatedly hearing the news, Bak Yerim made an appeal mixed with tears in front of the camera.<br />
Interspersing her speech with her story with Han Yoojin, she sniffled, asking the kidnapper to please return ahjussi safely if they were watching this.<br />
Yoo Myeongwoo also worried about his friend with a face overcast with shadows.<br />
Like a snowball that had started to roll, interest related to the disappearance became bigger.  </p>
<p>What do you mean Hong Kong, out of nowhere!Bak Yerim shouted, with a clear face devoid of tears.  </p>
<p>It was closed at the end of last year due to the aftermath of an A-Rank dungeon break.<br />
At Suk Simyeong’s words, Bak Yerim had a regretful face.<br />
She had wanted to go to an amusement park with ahjussi.<br />
At her grumbling, Han Yoohyun, who had been staring piercingly at the contracts spread out on top of the table, raised his head.  </p>
<p>We cannot know when some kind of problem will occur.<br />
Please do not think flippantly.<br />
That is why I think even more that I should go.<br />
I have an instant movement and flight skill, so I can go there by secretly getting on a plane like Noah oppa.<br />
And I can quickly take ahjussi out, too.<br />
Don’t you not have any hiding skills? If you happen to be caught, it can become dangerous for hyung.<br />
Bak Yerim was too inexperienced to skillfully hide her body without a hiding skill.<br />
At the cold words, Bak Yerim pouted and let out a big sigh.  </p>
<p>Would ahjussi be eating well? We have to quickly push down the Association or whatever and bring him back.<br />
It really is done with exactly three days, right.<br />
We have joined with Chief Song’s team, and tracking down the related people is already almost done.<br />
Suk Simyeong said.<br />
However, in order to completely mop them up, there is a need to strive for caution, so it will likely take two to three more days.<br />
…We can just use my skill.<br />
White Corpse.<br />
If she used the skill that plucked out memories from corpses, they could catch the people involved in Han Yoojin’s kidnapping much faster and more easily.<br />
But Han Yoojin wanted that skill that could only be used when people died, to be used as little as possible.<br />
He also entreated them to stop Yerim from using the skill unless it was a case where it really couldn’t be helped.  </p>
<p>Right, what is Seseong, the Seseong Guild Leader ahjussi doing?At any rate, that ahjussi seemed to be capable.<br />
It was when Bak Yerim was saying that she’ll try to call Kang Soyoung since it would probably end faster if he helped.  </p>
<p>Excuse me……Do Hamin, who was sitting in front of the communication equipment, opened his mouth while looking around.  </p>
<p>Contact came from Noah-ssi just now.<br />
The people’s gazes focused on him.<br />
Do Hamin, who wasn’t used to being placed in front of high rank Hunters, S-Rank Hunters, was flustered as he pushed up his glasses.<br />
com for a better experience.<br />
That is… He said the Seseong Guild Leader is in Hong Kong.<br />
…Excuse me?Han Yoohyun let out a bewildered noise.<br />
Bak Yerim’s eyes also became round.  </p>
<p>And at the same hotel as Landlord, Han Yoojin-ssi, at that.<br />
Ah, what is this? That ahjussi sure is fast! As expected, I will go as well!Bak Yerim squawked, and this time, even Han Yoohyun didn’t stop her.<br />
*** The morning sunlight poured in through the glass that filled the surface of the wall.<br />
The calmly ordered room service was set out on top of the table.<br />
It was a simple breakfast of scrambled eggs, bacon, sausages, roasted mushrooms, etc.<br />
Thick mango juice also filled one glass.<br />
Spearing a firm sausage with a fork, I stared at the man sitting on the other side.<br />
Maybe he really was a guest here, because his outfit was loose and light.<br />
com ‘Should I have also made a contract for the appearance of Sung Hyunjae?’ Though I wasn’t some kind of fortune teller, and hadn’t even dreamed that this person would pop up here.<br />
On top of that, he came in normally, opening the door with a hotel key, without any disturbance.<br />
In other words, it meant that he received my room key from the slaver.<br />
It wasn’t that there was no possibility of him robbing them, but it was too peaceful for that to have been the case.  </p>
<p>Could it possibly be that the reason you have information about the people aiming for me, is because you are in collusion with them?Sung Hyunjae had a relaxed smile at the question asking if he was on the same side as those guys and had deceived me, us.  </p>
<p>Would that be so? I’m a guest who received an invitation.<br />
I received a suggestion to come watch, since a precious item came in, so I came here.<br />
They invited, not anybody else, but the Seseong Guild Leader? Did an invitation not go to Haeyeon.<br />
The one who was invited wasn’t the Seseong Guild Leader.<br />
The eggs were soft.  </p>
<p>I came as a substitute.<br />
Are you talking about a substitute for yourself?Sung Hyunjae didn’t respond.<br />
I rested my gaze on the sound blocking item on top of one side of the table, and then opened my mouth again.  </p>
<p>You brought two S-Rank Hunters over from abroad.<br />
Noah Luire and Evelyn Miller.<br />
If he was able to take charge of those two, wouldn’t his influence abroad be bigger than Korea’s Seseong? Somehow, that side of Sung Hyunjae may be the main identity.<br />
Though I didn’t think deeply of it up to now, since I wasn’t interested in paying attention to even the matters outside of the country.  </p>
<p>I already showed you a lot, so please reveal one or two of your cards as well.<br />
Didn’t I personally come here like this.<br />
Ah, yes.<br />
You are not a substitute.<br />
I am quite curious what you did before you Awakened.<br />
Things that were known about him were few.<br />
First of all, he apparently had Korean citizenship, but his past was really unclear, and due to the light coloring of his appearance, there was some suspicion that he was a foreigner, or multiracial.<br />
There were also rumors that he was a serious criminal but that the country had buried his past because he was an S-Rank Awakened Person.<br />
Seeing how Seseong Guild quickly established itself, speculation that he was a considerably wealthy person before Awakening circulated like a widely accepted opinion, too.<br />
com Would it be just that? His record after Awakening was more dumbfounding.<br />
The world’s strongest, the 1st place in the ranking competitions.<br />
The owner of Korea’s top guild.<br />
There was hidden influence even abroad, and the person who had collaborated with both the filial duty addicts and the immoral people.<br />
They were specs that suited a protagonist who saves the world in fiction.<br />
Though his personality completely didn’t.<br />
He was also a little old.<br />
Since, there were exceptions but it was usually young kids who were full of vigor.<br />
‘Though realistically, an adult with a lot of experience and who has established themself in society and has good abilities would be more likely to save the world than young kids.<br />
’ If I hadn’t regressed, what would’ve happened? That amazing person could have somehow safely blocked the dungeons and gained a hundred years of a grace period.<br />
Even if he didn’t, the things that Sung Hyunjae had piled up for 5 years had basically become bubbles in an instant through me regressing.<br />
My conscience was veeery slightly pricked.  </p>
<p>If I said that I possibly caused an incredible loss for Sung Hyunjae-ssi, what will you do.<br />
Is that a declaration of war?Unlike the usual him, his eyes shone as he smiled.<br />
Looking at that, the guilt that had raised its head a tiny bit cleanly disappeared.<br />
Even if I said, ‘I ruined your work by regressing’, he would probably find it fun.<br />
I am thinking of enjoying four days of vacation and then going back.<br />
I placed the fork on top of the empty plate as I asked him what he was going to do.<br />
It would be good if he didn’t interfere with my road home.  </p>
<p>I’m thinking of using one of the three times of your help.<br />
Pulling that out now of all times?.<br />
What are you going to make me do.<br />
Honeypot[1.<br />
Why honey again?.<br />
Han Yoojin-gun is really good bait.<br />
I am aware.<br />
Rather than reeling in, it’s cleaning.<br />
You seem like someone who has never wiped a desk once in his life.<br />
Throwing the whole thing away instead of wiping it, is also a method of cleaning.<br />
It’s the same in that it becomes clean, right?It wasn’t a cleaning method of this world.<br />
Anyways, the extremist cleaner wanted me to quietly play the role of merchandise and gather the things to clean.  </p>
<p>What if I really happen to be sold off like that.<br />
I’ll take responsibility and win the bid for you.<br />
And put that money into the debt again.<br />
I was thinking of taking care of the expenses, but if you insist on paying back.<br />
It is the expenses, of course.<br />
com I drank the remaining mango juice as I took stock of the situation.<br />
It seemed like Sung Hyunjae didn’t like the act of selling Awakening People.<br />
Of course it wasn’t an ethical reason like ‘human trafficking is a crime’.<br />
It seemed like it was just an eyesore to him so he wanted to overturn it.  </p>
<p>Above all, simply buying and selling isn’t fun.<br />
Is your standard for living in the world ‘fun’? Please try pursuing some other sincere goal.<br />
I have everything else.<br />
Fuck, alright, you’re amazing.<br />
Ah, how annoying.<br />
Anyways, my reason was also different, but I was in agreement over sweeping away the sons of bitches who bought and sold people.<br />
I thought of the time Myeongwoo signed a slave contract.<br />
What would those sons of bitches be doing around now? Putting a leash on people with an irrational contract was bad too, but it couldn’t be compared to people actually openly kidnapping and selling others.<br />
And, it was true that it was the result of a sting operation, but I was the victim, so there was no need to tolerate it.  </p>
<p>com Eating the pheasant, and eating the egg[2, and emptying the nest and setting it on fire[3.<br />
It happened to be Hong Kong, so it was a perfect position.<br />
Hearing my explanation, Sung Hyunjae laughed cheerfully.  </p>
<p>How should I express my feelings for Han Yoojin-gun.<br />
What expressing – no thank you.<br />
I have heard that you will fall for me twice already.<br />
It feels like I will start to get tired of it, so please change your repertoire up a little.<br />
Do not make do with just your words.<br />
You burned the roses and flung away the watch, so what is left.<br />
Ah, that’s really enough, and just give me some money.<br />
So I can buy a souvenir.<br />
I was dragged here without a single cent.<br />
Sung Hyunjae took out a card from his wallet and gave it to me, with the same smiling face.<br />
The limit should be big enough, right? What should I buy for the kids? *** It was only after staying stretched out the whole time, and ordering and eating dinner as well through room service, that I left the room and went to the lounge.<br />
The hotel employees were incredibly hospitable.<br />
Starting from the elevator button, from the lounge room door to even the table’s chair, none of those had a chance to touch my hand.<br />
com Gregson came towards me as I was eating macarons and tea while staring at the night view that was run down compared to the past.<br />
I returned a smile at him making conversation still with a good-natured face, saying that I looked more comfortable than yesterday.  </p>
<p>The reception is good, so I automatically became relaxed.<br />
Though it is not that I am not worried for the future.<br />
You will be treated to more than this wherever you go, so please do not worry so much.<br />
”Advertisements While I was laughing and chatting with the guy who was trying to sell me, a group of people came into the lounge.<br />
The old man who was surrounded in the middle of the group like he was being protected, looked closely at me.<br />
The person who came in a short while later and, as expected, had Hunters as guards, also placed their gaze on me.<br />
It looked like they were the customers.<br />
I felt dirty, but I had to play the role of exemplary merchandise for a while, so I received the gazes with a smiling face.<br />
Ah, it would be great if the cleaning started soon.<br />
When the slaver guy left, the customers approached and even started up conversations eventually.<br />
I wondered if I had to humor them to this extent even though it wasn’t even real, so I went back up to the room.  </p>
<p>Whew, I’m starting to want to see the kids.<br />
com -Chirp I heard a familiar baby bird noise again.<br />
Continuing, a pure white cotton ball was crossing over the soft carpet, when it stopped at my feet.<br />
Black eyes looked up at me and happily opened its beak.<br />
-Chirp, cheep! …W-why was it here?! [1 in eng transliterated to krn, but given context, I don’t think it’s the usual eng def of ‘honeypot’ but more of like… general bait.<br />
unless the eng def also means that but like… i’ve only heard of ‘honeypot’ in terms of seduction in spy movies or we [2 ‘eat the pheasant and eat the egg’ is an idiom that’s similar to ‘kill two birds with one stone’ (which also has a krn equiv that is the same thing both literally and metaphorically), ‘take your cake and eat it’, etc.<br />
Normally I tl idioms into the eng equiv or the general meaning, but yj extends the metaphor in the rest of the sentence so I left it as is.<br />
[3 the reason why the commas are where they are, is bc the grammatical structure separates the sentence into those 3 phrases.<br />
The verb used for the ‘setting fire’ is more like ’[use sth to make a fire (usually for a fireplace, campfire, etc.<br />
)’, so in this case it’s more like ‘emptying the nest in order to use it to make a fire’ instead of ‘emptying the nest’ being a separate action in and of itself.  </p>

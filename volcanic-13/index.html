<p>Editor: Summerstood, Imagine
â€˜Ugh.
 What happened in the past again?
In his past life, when he was ten years old, he focused on training his martial arts by going and returning from the Nak An Hell.</p>
<p>He didnt have the leisure to put attention on other things.</p>
<p>Most of all, that was something from before the age of war.
 He had almost no information about that.</p>
<p>The things Ju Seo Cheon knew about were mostly related to the age of war.
 And it also started from the battle of Hansam.</p>
<p>The things that happened before that were really trivial things and the things he knew about that were also few.
 Hahaha, I dont know how long its been since I received a mission.</p>
<p>Yu Jong Mok smiled in a really good mood regardless of his disciples anxiousness.
 Ju Seo Cheon wanted to say something while stamping his feet anxiously but he couldnt do so.</p>
<p>It was because he knew better than anyone else how Yu Jong Mok was feeling.</p>
<p>He had been excluded from missions even though he had the skills.
 Even if he did receive some missions, those were short term ones or comparatively easy ones.</p>
<p>Long term missions required a lot of endurance.
 In case of urgent missions, he wouldnt be able to do anything if the body of his temperature raised suddenly.</p>
<p>Thats why Yu Jong Mok was left out in various missions even though he was strong and regretted this situation.</p>
<p>At one point he got depressed saying that he couldnt pay off his debt.</p>
<p>So how would he be able to stop his master?
Even if he was worried, he wasnt in a position to stop him.</p>
<p>What mission is it? Ju Seo Cheon looked at Yu Jong Mok worriedly and asked.</p>
<p>And then, Yu Jong Mok made a comfortable smile and crouched down to be at the same eye level as his disciple.</p>
<p>Dont worry too much.
 Your master is not going out to die.
 I did fix this weak body of mine, but they didnt entrust a great mission to me as they werent certain of it.</p>
<p>His body had been repaired as he reached the pinnacle rank but they werent able to entrust him with important tasks.</p>
<p>Yu Jong Mok didnt have any performances yet but still had the record of having a frail body so they werent able to thim.</p>
<p>Yu Jong Mok also knew that fact so he didnt feel bad.</p>
<p>The chief executives of Mount Hua Sect decided to entrust Yu Jong Mok with an intermediate difficulty to test him.</p>
<p>I understand.
 I will pray for you to return safely.</p>
<p>Ju Seo Cheon sent off Yu Jong Mok with a half worried and half happy heart.</p>
<p>A great change would come to Ju Seo Cheon when he turned ten.</p>
<p>Ah, I already put up your name on the Lotus Peak examination so be prepared for it.
 If its you, you would probably be able to do it.</p>
<p>Cough, cough.</p>
<p>He started to cough as soon as he heard the name Lotus Peak.</p>
<p>â€˜No, why?
It would be good to spend his childhood without attracting too much attention.
 That would be the best way to spend the rest of his days as a child.</p>
<p>But why the Lotus Peak!
The Lotus Peak is a place where all the talents of Mount Hua gathered at.
 It is an institution where Mount Hua and even Murim pay attention to.</p>
<p>it was obvious to attract attention as most Plum Blossom Examiners came out from this place.</p>
<p>I dont know how long this mission will take, but there are not many people that would take care of you if you got out to Kang Ho.
 If you enter the Lotus Peak you wont have to worry about such things.
 No, they will be able to teach you better than this master of yours.</p>
<p>Thats not the case!
Hahaha, I always tell you this but you have the tendency to praise me more than necessary.
 Whatever the case, I believe you will be able to plentily enter the Lotus Peak.
 Ah, dont feel too burdened by it.
 Its fine if you fall out.</p>
<p>He got crazily burdened by it.</p>
<p>Affectionate eyes.
 And the emotions that were felt in those eyes was â€˜trust.</p>
<p>If it was his disciple, he would be easily able to enter the Lotus Peak.
 He was sure that there was no reason at all for his disciple to fall on the examination.</p>
<p>It wasnt excessive for Yu Jong Mok to think like that.
 Ju Seo Cheon had skills to back it up.</p>
<p>Okay, I will leave now.</p>
<p>Ju Seo Cheon was about to put on a teary face but he didnt want to worry Yu Jong Mok, that was too weak when it came to his disciple, so he smiled brightly and sent him off smiling.</p>
<p>Four days later.</p>
<p>Ah, fuck it.</p>
<p>Ju Seo Cheon pulled out his hair and screamed.</p>
<p>Just what do I have to do?
Ju Seo Cheon shed tears of blood at the problem his master left him.
 He wasnt able to sleep properly these past four days due to the examination of the Lotus Peak.</p>
<p>Thinking about it rationally he had to fail on the examination.
 If he passed the exam he would receive attention and it would become bothersome.</p>
<p>There was no need to worry about the Purple Haze Arts getting discovered but there were still other bothersome things.</p>
<p>But his emotions were headed in a completely different direction.</p>
<p>â€˜Are you planning to betray the trust of your master!
His master, Yu Jong Mok, was a God.
 His God said that he believed in him so it was hard to ignore that expectation.</p>
<p>He wanted to fulfill his expectations by entering the Lotus Peak.</p>
<p>â€˜Ha.
 I really wanted to enter that place in my past life but Im now wondering whether to enter or not!
The Lotus Peak.
 His chest trembled just by hearing that name.</p>
<p>The Lotus Peak was a sacred place for the inner disciples.
 Entering that place meant that they were evaluated as the hope of Mount Hua Sect.</p>
<p>It also meant getting closer to becoming a Plum Blossom Examiner, that was the idols of the disciples of Mount Hua so it could only be a holy place for them.</p>
<p>Ju Seo Cheon also admired the Lotus Peak before he returned in time.
 It was an institution that all the disciples of Mount Hua Sect admired.</p>
<p>Ju Seo Cheon had dreamed of living a better life since having returned in time.
 It would be a lie if he said that he didnt feel any emotions.</p>
<p>Ju Seo Cheon went to practice the Plum Blossom Sword Arts in a secluded area, this was to help in organizing his thoughts.</p>
<p>Besides that, he also trained in the Fourteen Stances of the Plum Blossom Sword, the Withered Flower Sword Art and the Universe Sword Art that not even Yu Jong Mok was able to learn.</p>
<p>He also wanted to train in the Purple Haze Sword Wave but that was something he could only do after he reached the fourth star in the Purple Haze Arts.</p>
<p>â€˜Actually, im already receiving attentionâ€¦
Not everyone could become pinnacle experts.</p>
<p>Most of all Yu Jong Mok had become a candidate for the Plum Blossom Sword Examiner.
 That alone was enough to get recognized.</p>
<p>Because of this Yu Jong Mok was quite well known inside the Hua Sect, although he wasnt that known outside of Kang Ho.</p>
<p>Some of his prestige disappeared after Ju Seo Cheon became his disciple but that appeared once again after he became a pinnacle expert.</p>
<p>After Yu Jong Mok became a famous person, stories about his disciple also spread.</p>
<p>It even spread to the visitors or disciples that wanted to form a connection with Yu Jong Mok.</p>
<p>He couldnt easily make a conclusion because he couldnt choose between following his mind or heart.</p>
<p>My head already hurts because of the Three Eyed Immoral Godâ€¦.
huh?
The Lotus Peak, avoiding attention, and the treasury of the Three Eyed Immoral God.
 These three factors lined up and arranged a new list of information.</p>
<p>After sweating a bit by practicing in swordsmanship, he put his feet in the waters of the ravine and organized the thoughts that appeared in his head.</p>
<p>The day the treasury of the Three Eyed Immoral God would open was five years later.
 He would have to go out to Kang Ho a year or two later anyways.</p>
<p>He didnt know exactly how many treasures there were in the treasury but he did know that it wasnt few.</p>
<p>He would need at least a year to move and hide all of that.
 He may have to receive the help of another person but he also needed at least two years to get someone he could trust.</p>
<p>It would at least take one year or two.
 So, he would have to go out to Kang Ho when he was thirteen.</p>
<p>He felt troubled because he didnt know how he should act next but a thought had entered his head
You stupid bastard!
Ju Seo Cheon blamed his dull head and got angry.
 He felt that the time he spent thinking until now was for nothing.</p>
<p>If I want to go out to Kang Ho when Im thirteen, normal methods arent going to work anyways.</p>
<p>Even if I request that to my master not even he would be able to receive permission if it wasnt reasonable enough.</p>
<p>No, in the first place he didnt even know what he should ask his master to receive help.</p>
<p>But there was a way that could solve this painstaking matter.
 It was a really simple method.</p>
<p>The reason the disciples of Mount Hua were sent off after they became twenty years old was simple.
 It was because they didnt want the disciples they raised to die because they didnt have enough skills.</p>
<p>But of course, they didnt only send off the fourth generation disciples to Kang Ho.
 They put skilled third generation disciples as their protectors.</p>
<p>But you couldnt know what could happen to one person.
 No, what could happen in Kangho.
 They didnt know what variable was there.</p>
<p>Thats why they evaluate your martial prowess to make sure its enough to survive that variable.</p>
<p>â€˜The treasury of the Three Eyed Immoral God and attracting attention.
 Theres nothing to speak about if we put these two on a scale.
 The treasury comes first.</p>
<p>The worth of the treasury was astronomical and the uses for the treasures in that treasury were endless.</p>
<p>First would be the miraculous medicine.
 What Ju Seo Cheon lacked was internal energy so if he solved that, achieving the same prowess he had in his past life would only be a matter of time.</p>
<p>The second were the manuals and weapons.
 These two would be used to gather people that would fight with him in the era of war.</p>
<p>Besides that, he could also use them as bait so it would be good to take them.</p>
<p>â€˜Lets keep an appropriate line to not attract too much attention.
 Im young anyways so they wont be that wary of me.
 I will only show enough skills to enter the Lotus Peak.</p>
<p>His head spun quickly.</p>
<p>He had thought of the big picture.
 Its only a fraction but he had set up a considerable frame.</p>
<p>Whew.
 Even though I obtained a new life I still feel as if Ive made no progress.</p>
<p>A sigh came out of Ju Seo Cheons mouth by its own.</p>
<p>The things you know are for nothing.
 You dont even know how to use them properly.
 Reflect on it Ju Seo Cheon.</p>
<p>Ju Seo Cheon hit his own head and got a hold of himself.</p>
<p>He was certainly a steps ahead of others but that was it.
 He didnt know if he would be able to act properly on variables.</p>
<p>In the first place, the person called Ju Seo Cheon wasnt that capable.
 He had merely followed the teachings of Mount Hua Sect.</p>
<p>He was only accustomed to receiving orders.
 If someone asked him if he was wise, he wouldnt know how to answer.</p>
<p>He barely reached the pinnacle rank by staying alive and luck followed him when he was on deaths bed that he was able to become an Unrestrained Realm Expert.</p>
<p>That was everything.
 He wasnt anything.</p>
<p>He was just a commoner.
 He wasnt outstanding but didnt fall behind either.
 It was only that.
 Ju Seo Cheon reminded himself of that.</p>
<p>In the first place, if he was so wise as to be able to bring good results with a little bit of thinking, he would have been recognized by everyone even in his past life and become a proper elder.</p>
<p>If we were to talk about the good points Ju Seo Cheon had, it was that he knew discretion.</p>
<p>Thanks to that he somehow stayed alive during the era of war.</p>
<p>The time I have left is three years.
 I will get great results at the entrance test of the Lotus Peak that will take place this year.
 I will then nag my master somehow and force him to let me leave for Kang Ho.
 Working hard doesnt go mix well with me, but I cant do anything about it.</p>
<p>Three years.</p>
<p>The time limit was until he reached thirteen.</p>
<p>Ju Seo Cheon decided to bet everything.
 Entering the Lotus Peak! Appearing in Kang Ho! And the treasury of the Three Eyed Immoral God!
He remembered these three things.</p>

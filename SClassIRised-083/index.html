<p>Fear Resistance .<br />
Past the lobby, there were neatly made pens[1 spread across the rearing room on the righthand side.<br />
They were big enough to be close to rooms, rather than pens, and there were, of course air purifying and temperature adjustment installations, but also CCTV installed.<br />
Apparently, the relatively smaller pen could withstand up to standard level 10 and stat B, and the largest pen up to A.<br />
The unicorns were also already moved to here.<br />
There was Peace and Blue, too, on the nameplates on the pens.<br />
While I wasn’t here, they would stay here where the Hunter in charge was.<br />
In the pen that didn’t have a owner yet, the nest from Seseong was placed and Comet was lowered on it.<br />
-Sii shwik! The baby dragon wrapped their long tail around my wrist and snorted at Blue who was loitering outside.<br />
There was a difference in their weight class and abilities, so it couldn’t lunge at her, but it seemed incredibly upset.  </p>
<p>Alright, alright.<br />
Blue can’t come in, so sleep here.<br />
Then I left Blue and Chirpie to the rearing room as well.<br />
My things were still at the dorms, so I was thinking of taking them home after it was all moved in.<br />
There wasn’t a lot, but there wouldn’t be anything left while trying to move along with the kids, especially Blue.<br />
Kang Soyoung left to go shopping, saying that she would decorate Comet’s pen.<br />
Emulate this, Han Yoohyun.<br />
Hurry up and come out and bring in a highest class pet bed into Peace’s pen at least.<br />
com for a better experience.<br />
You can use the mini portal to the 2nd floor as long you have the registration key.<br />
Sung Hyunjae said, taking out of his inventory and showing a card the size of a business card that was made from an S-Rank magic stone thinly cut with a code placed in it.<br />
But why was that person holding the registration key?.<br />
There are six registration keys in total, with the four guilds, excluding MKC, having one each.<br />
The remaining two are Han Yoojin-gun’s.<br />
They were sent to Haeyeon Guild, so you just have to go and take it.<br />
Do I not have any privacy?Why would you divvy up and take someone else’s house keys?.<br />
There’s another door inside, so don’t worry.<br />
If it is a normal door, it would be like a piece of paper to an S-Rank.<br />
It’s not to that extent – about a wooden plank? It was made specially in its own way.<br />
There wasn’t much of a difference between things that would break after being hit.<br />
Though there was no helping it since there was no way to make sure some problem wouldn’t occur at home.<br />
Apparently the house’s outer walls can endure against an A-Rank combat Hunter for about 30 minutes.<br />
It is durable.<br />
A 3rd Rank armored dragon’s skin was used as the exterior material.<br />
There wasn’t a way to process it, so A-Rank Hunters had to be put to it.<br />
I’m much obliged.<br />
There weren’t any dungeons within the country where 3rd rank armored dragons came out, so did they import it from overseas? The house key was also sent to Haeyeon, so I couldn’t go inside.<br />
They certainly must’ve made it well.<br />
Besides that, Sung Hyunjae pointlessly kindly explained the training room, maintenance room, reception room, etc.<br />
I felt sorry for Song Taewon’s whose mouth kept on being blocked, so I tried showing it in my own way, but it didn’t get through at all.  </p>
<p>Seseong Guild Leader.<br />
You should be busy, so I apologize for taking up so much of your time.<br />
I will hear the rest from Chief Song Taewon.<br />
At the words saying to go back to your place, Sung Hyunjae’s gaze went towards me.<br />
The corners of his eyes thinly held a smile.  </p>
<p>The time I give to you isn’t wasteful at all, so don’t worry.<br />
com Fuck, beating about the bush really didn’t get through.  </p>
<p>It is burdensome to me, so please leave.<br />
I threw a fast ball.<br />
When I did, he put on a hurt face.<br />
Crazy.<br />
……As expected, crazy.  </p>
<p>You’re more heartless than you look.<br />
…We do not have a relationship where things like ‘heartless’ are relevant, do we.<br />
I thought I put in quite a lot of sincerity.<br />
Besides checking the skill, I haven’t treated you badly either.<br />
Truthfully, isn’t it rarer to accept that type of skill defenselessly?Shortly after thinking ‘what nonsense is this’.<br />
‘Did Sung Hyunjae… treat me quite well……?’ Thinking back on it, besides rejecting the skill, there wasn’t a time where he had hurt me.<br />
When I had gone to Seseong too, he was amicable the whole time, and I even received Peace’s toy and the earrings.<br />
And when we went into the dungeon, he was a problem because he picked fights with other people, but he listened well to me.<br />
He also bought a present and came to visit me at the hospital, and today, he broke Song Taewon’s car, but thanks to that, we came here comfortably.<br />
com It did seem like he was being sincere to me, like he said.<br />
‘……It feels like I’m falling for a scam.<br />
’ Considering how he’s an amazing giant guild leader, he was incredible genial.<br />
Even now when he had heard me openly tell to him get lost, he didn’t show at all that he was angry.<br />
It was definitely like that, and he wasn’t wrong about the skill, and they were all truths that I had directly gone through, but why did I keep on feeling like I was being deceived? When I was being dissatisfied, Yerim grabbed my arm.  </p>
<p>Ahjussi, don’t be taken in!What did you mean ‘taken in’.<br />
It was super icky.  </p>
<p>Thinking over it, it is so.<br />
You paid much attention to me during this time.<br />
I acknowledged that.<br />
I continued, to the smiling face.<br />
So, please show me some kindness this time as well.<br />
If you go back without much trouble, I could feel touched a little.<br />
If you’re going to treat me well, treat me well to the end.<br />
At the continuing words turning him away, Sung Hyunjae’s eyes quickly turned chilly.<br />
I am the person who is raising your place’s child, please calm down.  </p>
<p>It seems I have no choice.<br />
The one who falls for the other first[2, is the one who loses.<br />
What was he even saying.<br />
Sung Hyunjae gazed at Song Taewon once, and then obediently turned around.<br />
He clearly should’ve had a secret scheme, but he listened to me so well that it was uncomfortable instead.  </p>
<p>Yerim, you should start to go, to take the classes you skipped.<br />
How can I go, leaving ahjussi.<br />
This is my house now.<br />
There’s also Hunters who are already guarding it.<br />
com At my words, Yerim glared at the silently standing Song Taewon.  </p>
<p>Even so, they’re only A-Ranks.<br />
If that ahjussi also leaves with me, then I’ll go.<br />
Even if she was an S-Rank, Yerim wouldn’t be able to match up to him yet.<br />
He was the person who had the most combat experience against Hunters, instead of monsters, within the country.<br />
He would be able to easily subdue low-level Yerim.  </p>
<p>Why are you so aggressive? Even if he does something or the other, he’s a public official, so would anything happen? And he wouldn’t just drag somebody away without procedures.<br />
I do sometimes.<br />
Song Taewon said unreservedly.<br />
…So he did drag people away.<br />
I didn’t know.<br />
Yerim put more strength into the hand grabbing my arm.<br />
It hurt.  </p>
<p>B-Rank and higher Hunters are capable of mass destruction, so immediate restraint is possible under my judgement.<br />
According to skill, it can be applicable to C-Rank and lower Hunters as well.<br />
…Ahjussi is also B-Rank, now.<br />
Yerim whispered, frowning.<br />
Though I was stat F with zero attack skills.<br />
Truthfully, even if someone is dragged away, rather than me, Yerim, you would be first… hey hey.<br />
Don’t pinch me.<br />
The adults around her were bad, so I worried that it wouldn’t be far before something happened so that I would have to visit a detention center.  </p>
<p>Of course, I have not come with that purpose today, so if you have not committed illegal actions, you can be relieved.<br />
…There was murder, threatening, assault.<br />
Though I wouldn’t get caught.<br />
When I told Yerim to go to class again, she sent a gaze full of mistrust.  </p>
<p>You wouldn’t come up in the 9 o’clock news, or something, right.<br />
Then send me food from outside[3.<br />
Yerim’s grumbling brought something to mind, so I took out a pen and memo sheet made from dungeon byproducts from my inventory.<br />
After writing down two phone numbers on the memo, I gave it to Yerim.  </p>
<p>In the unlikely case that I go missing, contact here and ask them to find me.<br />
com for a better experience.<br />
You’ll know if you call.<br />
Don’t call pointlessly, though.<br />
It was Do Hamin’s and Yoon Yoon’s contact information.<br />
I had changed my phone, but I had my ID card that was issued a long time ago, so if she commissioned Do Hamin, she would be able to find my location immediately.<br />
And Yoon Yoon, who had been stat B and couldn’t take others very far, was now stat S and had the ultra long distance portal skill, so an easy and safe escape was possible.<br />
It meant that as long as I stayed alive, there wasn’t any need to worry.<br />
When I pacified Yerim and sent her off, finally it was just Song Taewon and me.<br />
There wasn’t really any need to go around the facility more, so we went to the reception room that we had passed before.  </p>
<p>You have not come to actually drag me away, correct?I asked nonsensically, as we walked.  </p>
<p>No.<br />
Though I have met with your brother a while ago.<br />
Since there were several dead people through Han Yoojin-ssi’s kidnapping case.<br />
I was a little surprised because it was the first time the Haeyeon Guild Leader accepted investigations that obediently.<br />
That… if it was the first time, does that mean there were similar situations before that.<br />
It should have been about a quarterly event.<br />
Quarterly… four times a year…… Yoohyun?! With complicated feelings, I opened the reception room door.<br />
It was a luxuriously decorated room with one wall made out of glass.<br />
There was also a fairly large break room attached.<br />
Right now, there wasn’t anybody here, but soon, I should hire employees.  </p>
<p>I have not… heard about such things.<br />
Was there possibly a time when the problem was quite serious.<br />
Seeing as there are not many things that are known publicly, it makes sense that you do not know.<br />
It is rare for things to not be serious with S-Rank Hunters, but still, it is much better lately.<br />
Since dungeon breaks barely occur.<br />
Song Taewon continued speaking, smiling slightly.  </p>
<p>As the usage of attack skills cannot be restricted in regions where dungeon breaks have occurred, previously, I had to be resolved to lose about an arm, if my luck was bad.<br />
As you know, the Haeyeon Guild Leader’s disposition is not normal.<br />
com for the best novel reading experience.<br />
….<br />
I apologize.<br />
When I hesitated, unsure of what I had to say, Song Taewon apologized.  </p>
<p>Ah, no.<br />
Or rather, I apologize.<br />
My brother is… it seems like he caused you much trouble.<br />
Ah, shit, Yoohyun, what did you go around doing? It wasn’t a different guild or an ordinary Hunter, so why did ‘resolve to throw away an arm’ come from a public official’s mouth?.<br />
Please do not pay too much mind.<br />
It is common for high rank Hunters to be sensitive while handling dungeons bursting, which are not even dungeon attacks.<br />
Especially if two or more S-Rank Hunters enter the same region of a break, there is no other method than to put up restriction lines and have healers on standby.<br />
Nevertheless, it was an uneasy time, so it was not known to the public.<br />
Considering that time, nowadays is really peaceful.<br />
That, Yoohyun… the Haeyeon Guild Leader also possibly……Song Taewon lost the calm expression he had maintained from the beginning and showed a helpless smile.  </p>
<p>I am becoming afraid of truthfully telling you a review of that time.<br />
You can see it as something that S-Rank Hunters who awakened initially have gone through at least once.<br />
So I was considerably worried when I heard the news that four S-Rank Hunters would go into the same dungeon.<br />
On top to that, two of them… nevermind.<br />
com They did pick fights with each other, but there wasn’t a big problem.<br />
I remembered Yoohyun being regretful that there was no reason for S-Rank Hunters to gather like that in a dungeon.<br />
If they originally fought with each other a lot, it must have piled up a lot, since it had been quite a long time since dungeon breaks became rare.<br />
In that time, their abilities would have changed a lot; it made sense that they were curious.<br />
Still, it was wrong.<br />
Wait for the relatively safer ranking competitions to appear.  </p>
<p>Um, would you like something to drink? Should I give you coffee at least?Drinks were cheap, so it should be fine.<br />
Song Taewon nodded his head.<br />
When I went into the break room, I saw a large coffee machine.<br />
How did you use it… When I opened the cupboard, there was also instant coffee.  </p>
<p>The reason I came looking for you today, is to check Han Yoojin-ssi’s status.<br />
I was ripping the instant coffee bag, when I suddenly heard the voice behind me.<br />
Why didn’t you just wait; why come in here too?.<br />
My status?When I turned around, Song Taewon was looking down at me with that usual calm face.  </p>
<p>Yes.<br />
Han Yoojin-ssi’s stats are F.<br />
On the other hand, the ranks of your special skills are high.<br />
It means you are someone who is very easy to lay a hand on.<br />
com That, I also knew.<br />
That was why Yoohyun occasionally made suggestions, and I also paid attention in my own way and made my current place.  </p>
<p>You had a discussion with five guilds, but because of MKC, the balance has collapsed.<br />
I have heard that Hanshin is also receiving pressure in various ways.<br />
Was that why there was absolutely no contact from Hanshin?.<br />
Since apparently, they were taking Han Yoojin-ssi into an A-Rank dungeon in the middle of that chaos, I was suspicious.<br />
Specifically, it was me taking them, though.  </p>
<p>Have you possibly ever received mental or physical harm.<br />
…Excuse me? Well, I was tired because they kept on trying to fight.<br />
But it was about that much.<br />
You can speak comfortably.<br />
Is it not stranger for Han Yoojin-ssi to be unharmed? You may not know well, but there are skills and items that can manipulate people however one wants in the Hunters community.<br />
On top of that, the lower your stats are, the easier it is for those to be used.<br />
I also knew that.<br />
And there was a time when I was about to suffer damage.<br />
But now, there was no need to worry much.<br />
com Mind types, especially brainwashing types, didn’t affect even stat F’s, if they were stable mentally.<br />
And the easiest way to make someone unstable was definitely fear.<br />
You just needed simple preparations called violence and threats.<br />
‘But I have a fear resistance skill.<br />
’ Not even one eyebrow twitched in front of an SS-Rank monster, so what were they going to do? So I didn’t really worry about that kind of skill or item.  </p>
<p>I am fine, so you do not have to worry.<br />
Still, I was thankful that he did worry.<br />
At my reply, Song Taewon’s eyes became heavy and settled.<br />
It was strange, considering that it was a reaction to the words that I was alright.<br />
And then a hand touched my neck.<br />
The hand that I couldn’t notice coming closer, wrapped around my neck and a thick thumb lightly pressed over where my pulse was.  </p>
<p>Chief Song?It was a situation I didn’t really understand, so I was a little baffled.  </p>
<p>com A voice one step heavier pieced my ear.  </p>
<p>Sorry? There was not anyth- ugh.<br />
Strength was applied to the hand grabbing my neck.<br />
At the sensation of my breath being blocked, I did think that I had to do something no matter what, but there really wasn’t a method to.<br />
I wondered if I had to carry around an emergency bell or something.<br />
Before that, there wasn’t any reason for this to happen.  </p>
<p>Cough, cough!”[4 Thankfully, Song Taewon let go of me after not that long of a time passed.<br />
As the blocked breaths were spit out as coughs, I looked up at him.<br />
I mean, why-.  </p>
<p>Please excuse me.<br />
It seems that the one with the problem wasn’t the guild leaders, but Han Yoojin-ssi.<br />
……Sorry?Song Taewon opened a potion and held it out as he continued talking.<br />
com for a better experience.<br />
I have observed Han Yoojin-ssi the entire time since the hospital.<br />
I took the potion and took a sip.<br />
The pain in my neck settled down to a certain point.<br />
Was the reason why there wasn’t much of a reaction when Sung Hyunjae was being provoking, because he was watching me?.<br />
I thought it could be like that, up to Hunter Bak Yerim.<br />
She is still young, and you seemed considerably close.<br />
However, Han Yoojin-ssi treated even the Seseong Guild Leader comfortably.<br />
Since we are acquaintances, in a way.<br />
It makes even less sense because it is so.<br />
You have gone into an A-Rank dungeon together.<br />
I know that Han Yoojin-ssi lost consciousness on the 2nd floor, after the SS-Rank monster was killed.<br />
Is it correct that you have seen the Seseong Guild Leader attack the SS-Rank monster?I nodded my head.  </p>
<p>After confirming the strength of a fiend in a different league than you, treating that person however you like, is definitely not like a normal stat F-Rank.<br />
Ordinary people get frightened even after meeting a ferocious dog barking fiercely.<br />
If the leash is released and it wanders the surroundings, there is hardly anybody who could calmly face it.<br />
Not just that, Han Yoojin-ssi couldn’t feel fear at all in other situations.<br />
Other situations.<br />
Yes.<br />
Didn’t you stretch out your hand unhesitatingly at the baby dragon who had higher stats than you? Rather, Hunter Kang Soyoung was more worried.<br />
That is why I checked, risking discourtesy, but as expected, it was strange.<br />
com Was he talking about choking my neck? I was wondering why he was suddenly being like that, but he really didn’t have the intention to actually harm me.  </p>
<p>Even in a situation where your life was threatened, you were simply slightly surprised and taken aback – there was no indication that you were frightened at all.<br />
It was as if your fear was neutered.<br />
He was correct.  </p>
<p>Even so, that is not something bad, right.<br />
It is bad.<br />
Song Taewon said concisely.  </p>
<p>Right now, it is the same as if Han Yoojin-ssi’s warning light has been turned off.<br />
It is good that you can overcome fear, but if you do not have any from the start, you will simply become reckless.<br />
It is even more so because your stats are low.<br />
If a lamb does not get frightened in front of a wolf, what could happen?”Advertisements It would probably become well prepared dinner.  </p>
<p>But if it knows that wolves are dangerous, then it would run away right away.<br />
That is true, but the current Han Yoojin-ssi seems like the type who would try to observe wolves, thinking this distance should be fine.<br />
It is not completely dangerous, but it is also not safe.<br />
Was that so? But there were times when it was scary when the skill message window didn’t pop.<br />
When Yoohyun and Yerim were having their battle of nerves, I trembled a little, and I was a little scared when Suk Simyeong contacted me, and I was startled when I was told to gather 50 S-Ranks, and… …Thinking of it, lately, if it was a certain point, I just passed it over.<br />
Even when the S-Rank Hunters were growling as a group, rather than being afraid, I was annoyed.<br />
When Yoon Yoon changed into the demon king, the fear resistance skill’s message window didn’t pop up at all.<br />
Even if we knew each other, it was against an SS-Rank monster.<br />
Compared to about a month ago, I had definitely become insensitive.<br />
‘Am I getting dull because there is no stimulus?’ I thought that it could be dangerous if I left it like this.<br />
Should I leave the fear resistance off at least at home? Or watch a horror movie with it off.  </p>
<p>It seems that is accurate.<br />
I will try to be careful.<br />
Thank you for paying attention.<br />
……You are quite a difficult person.<br />
com At the expression of thanks, Song Taewon showed a slightly helpless smile.  </p>
<p>The finger marks on your neck have not even been erased completely yet.<br />
……Oh.<br />
This was strange, even when I thought about it.<br />
I should be careful.  </p>
<p>I would like to thank Han Yoojin-ssi personally.<br />
I was also worried about the Awakening Centers, but there was nothing I could do.<br />
So, I would like even more for there to not be any problems near you.<br />
He said that firstly, there were no big issues, so it was a relief.<br />
And then he took out a pen and a memo sheet from his inventory and wrote down a number.  </p>
<p>This is my personal contact information.<br />
If you happen to need help, please contact me any time.<br />
Thank you.<br />
”Advertisements But what should we do about Song Taewon-ssi’s way back? He didn’t even have a car.<br />
Um, there should be an employee or a Hunter with a car.<br />
I will ask them to escort you back-.<br />
No thank you.<br />
I will go directly on the subway.<br />
It wasn’t even a taxi, but the subway.<br />
I wanted to drive him if only I had a driver’s license.<br />
I should get one.  </p>
<p>Ah, I do not know if you have seen the news, but recently there are frequent terrorist attacks against Hunters.<br />
They are mainly aiming at the Hunter Association, but the rearing facility even has Yoo Myeongwoo-ssi added, so you should be careful, as you have become well known.<br />
Yes, I will.<br />
The group insisting that the dungeons had to burst open didn’t terrorize Korea until a long time later.<br />
I couldn’t remember well the instances overseas, but I definitely remembered the ones within the country.<br />
Still, there was no way for the future to be completely the same, so should I keep it in mind? [1 just fyi I’ve been tl-ing this word as either pen or cage depending on context, bc ‘cage’ in eng (to me) brings to mind more negative connotations [2 he doesn’t say the ‘for the other’ part, but if I left it as just ‘fall’, then it might be mistaken as like… physically falling or we, so I added that.<br />
He’s definitely saying ‘becoming enamored’ but it sounds better as ‘fall for sb’ which is why I tl’d it that way [3 the word for ‘food’ used is specifically ‘food brought for an inmate from outside’, so I added the ‘from outside’ to try to get that meaning across.<br />
[4 lit.<br />
‘kollok, kollok’ which are coughing sounds, but eng doesn’t really have those.  </p>

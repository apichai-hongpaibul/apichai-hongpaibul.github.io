<p>Ju Seo Cheon calmed his breathing.
 He had spent a bit of strength in coming here.
 No, Ju Seo Cheon why are you… Gu Pungs eyes shook while looking at Ju Seo Cheon.
 The only emotions that appeared on his face were confusion and doubts.
 I understand how you are feeling right now senior uncle but nows not the time.
 We dont know how the ones that are above will act.
 Ju Seo Cheon glanced at the scouts that were on top of the cliffs.
 What did the warriors do instead of stopping Seo Cheon!
Gu Pung raised his voice.
 For him, Ju Seo Cheons safety was a really sensitive subject.
 Th, that…
The warriors of the Murim Association didnt know how to respond.
 They were still dumbfounded.
 Zhuge Suran opened her mouth when no one spoke.
 You wouldnt believe this but young master Ju annihilated most of the pirates here.
 Suran, its dangerous.
 You attract too much attention already.
 Zhuge Sang hid Zhuge Suran behind him.
 That was a logical judgement.
 What?
Gu Pung was in disbelief but it seemed like it wasnt a lie as he checked the atmosphere in his surroundings.
 You didnt know either? Yook Dae Rang looked at Ju Seo Cheon as if it was unexpected.
 …Is that true?
Gu Pung looked at Ju Seo Cheon that was now standing by his side.
 Yes, senior uncle.</p>
<p>Ju Seo Cheon nodded.
 Just how…no, leave it.</p>
<p>Gu Pung had a lot of things to say but he decided to save them.
 It wasnt the time to act leisurely.
 Lets speak again if we get out of this safely.
 I will help you.
 No, you will only hinder me.
 Gu Pung declined immediately.
 I understand that you have been hiding your skills but you chose the worst opponent.
 Honestly speaking, I think that you will only hinder me instead of helping me.
 It would be a different story if he was at the peak rank, but people below that were of no help.</p>
<p>On top of that Ju Seo Cheon was someone he had to protect.
 He wouldnt be able to fight properly because he would be too worried about him.
 So just leave it to m…
You, you really speak a lot! Yook Dae Rang cut off Gu Pungs words and jumped forward.
 The ship shook greatly as the big man took a gigantic step.
 Gu Pung pushed Ju Seo Cheon back and dashed forward.
 Hurap! Yook Dae Rang performed a stab with all his strength.
 The weight behind the spear wasnt normal at all.
 Gu Pung saw that and spinned halfway in his place.
 The spear grazed by his waist.
 After that Gu Pung spun once again and swung his sword.
 ‘Okay! His sword was still shaking but he was certain this time.
 He believed that his would be to cut off the neck.
 Useless!
Yook Dae Rang inserted internal energy in his feet and stomped down.
 Boom! Uwaak! The stern of the ship sprang out slightly due to the force that was generated from the bow.
 Water passed the handrails and entered the ship.
 The few pirates that remained and the Murim Association group were also bewildered as the ship shook suddenly.
 The one that was the most flustered was Gu Pung.
 His already unsteady sword completely lost its path at the great shaking.
 He tried to rearm himself but it was too late.</p>
<p>Yook Dae Rang walked normally while everyone else had lost balance and attacked Gu Pung with his spear.
 Die! Gu Pung closed his eyes as he sensed his death.
 Who are you trying to touch! Ju Seo Cheon, who was waiting behind Gu Pung to guard him, stepped out and performed a sword technique towards Yook Dae Rang.
 Plum Blossom Falling Sunset? Gu Pung was shocked when he saw the sword technique that was performed in Ju Seo Cheons hands.
 It was the fifth stance of the Fourteen Stances of the Plum Blossom Sword.
 This arrogant brat…! Yook Dae Rangs pride was hurt when Ju Seo Cheon stopped his own attack and his face contorted in rage.
 You already look disgusting enough so dont do that! Ju Seo Cheon cracked a joke and executed the next stance.
 His sword turned blurry and the sword fell from above.
 It was the sixth stance, Plum Blossom Falling Petals.
 Keok! Yook Dae Rang raised his spear above his head and somehow managed to block the attack.</p>
<p>Ju Seo Cheon didnt stop and followed up with the next stance.
 Even the Plum Blossom Lined Confusion! Gu Pungs shock continued.
 The Fourteen Stances of the Plum Blossom Sword? Yook Dae Rangs face stiffened.
 He realized while receiving the attacks that the stances belonged to Gu Pungs swordsmanship.
 No, precisely speaking it was a sword technique of Mount Hua.
 ‘Now! Gu Pungs eyes were also able to see Yook Dae Rangs restlessness.</p>
<p>The sword technique Ju Seo Cheon displayed was truly shocking but he wasnt a fool to miss a golden opportunity such as this one.
 Gu Pung aimed for Yook Dae Rangs side and inched closer.
 He then stabbed with his sword like lightning.
 This damned! Yook Dae Rang raised up his internal energy and twisted his body.
 His insides hurt like hell because he suddenly changed the circulation of his internal energy.
 Buuuung! Gu Pungs sword tore apart Yook Dae Rangs flesh.
 They could see fat and flesh falling by the tip of the sword.
 Keok! Yook Dae Rang let out a groan from the pain he felt in his side but he did not have the luxury of being in pain.
 Movements that were messed up once were lethal in a battle between experts.
 And it was even more so if there were two enemies.
 Ju Seo Cheon continued to execute the Plum Blossom Lined Confusion stance.
 It was an unbearable mess that played with the eyes and senses of Yook Dae Rang.
 Screw off! Yook Dae Rang swung his spear.
 The aura that was contained in the blade of his spear changed into wind and stopped the confusing sword.
 Well done! Gu Pung praised Ju Seo Cheon and attacked Yook Dae Rangs back.
 He raised up all the internal energy in his body to form a sword aura.
 Yook Dae Rang turned his body hurriedly and parried off Gu Pungs sword aura.
 But his movements werent like before.
 The part that was torn away from his side was considerable.
 Pain followed him.
 Guuuugh! Yook Dae Rang wasnt able to contain his rage.
 It hurt his pride and annoyed him that he fell for such an attack.
 On top of that, he wasnt able to bear the fact that his underlings were watching all of this.</p>
<p>If rumors about this spread in the Nine Fleets of the Water Forest, it was obvious that the other fleet masters would laugh at him saying that he got done by a kid.
 Fuck off! Yook Dae Rang swung his spear again.
 It produced a destructive power that could sweep away everything in its surroundings and was felt in all the ship.
 The force behind the spear created pressure and it spread in a circle with him as the center and even created waves.</p>
<p>His full force attack headed towards Ju Seo Cheon first
.</p>
<p>‘No! Gu Pung moved quickly.
 Ju Seo Cheons strength was unexpected but he wasnt going to be able to stop that.
 That was what he thought.
 Heok! Ju Seo Cheon was also astonished at the pressure he could feel aimed all his body.
 That certainly wasnt normal.
 ‘But…this is an opportunity! A dense smile spread in Ju Seo Cheons face.</p>
<p>He raised his sword and spun it.
 He pressed the side of his sword with his palm and inserted all his internal energy that was almost sixty years worth.
 Foolish brat! Yook Dae Rang laughed at Ju Seo Cheon.
 He was sure that he wouldnt be able to block this attack.
 Kuaaaang-! The spear clashed with the sword.
 Wh, what?
But Yook Dae Rangs expectations were completely off.
 A kid a few times smaller than him stopped his spear with his sword.
 Ju Seo Cheon fell back about five steps.
 His footsteps were imprinted on the floor.
 Cough! But he wasnt able to block it perfectly.
 Ju Seo Cheon also vomited some blood.</p>
<p>It would have been good if he could form a sword aura but unfortunately, Ju Seo Cheon hadnt reached that boundary yet.</p>
<p>Instead, he utilized his vast internal energy ignorantly to block the attack.
 The almost sixty years worth of internal energy wasnt for show.
 Well done Seo Cheon! Gu Pung moved as if he was folding space.
 He was also using all his strength.
 Gu Pung dashed forward and stabbed his sword in Yook Dae Rangs back.
 Puuk! The tip of the sword tore apart the flesh of his back and pierced the chest that was at the opposite part.
 Kuhuk! Yook Dae Rang opened his eyes widely.
 Im, impossible… Yook Dae Rang bent his back and trembled.
 You lowered your guard, Slipping Water Spearman.
 Gu Pung pulled out his sword and fell back.
 I, I lowered my guard? Yook Dae Rang put a flustered expression.
 Kuhuk, dont kid with me… Who could have predicted a card like Ju Seo Cheon to appear? He executed the Fourteen Stances of the Plum Blossom Sword as well as a Plum Blossom Sword Examiner and even stopped his full force attack.
 Even if Zhuge Kong Ming returned, he wouldnt be able to predict something that was so out of common sense.
 The fleet master was defeated! Uaaak! Plop! The few pirates that survived threw themselves outside the ship.
 For them, doing this gave them more probabilities to survive.
 Damn… Yook Dae Rang mumbled with a spiteful voice.
 I, I cant….
cant die…alone! Yook Dae Rang yelled and grabbed his spear inversely.
 No! Gu Pung yelled urgently but it was too late.
 Yook Dae Rang had already raised his spear up high and stabbed it down.
 Baaaang! The bow of the ship, that had already become a mess because of Yook Dae Rang stamping down on it a while ago, couldnt endure this attack and was destroyed.
 The crack that formed in the bow spread like a spiderweb and covered the entire ship, and then it finally shattered in pieces.
 Uagh!
Agh!
Plop
The survivors and the dead that were on the ship fell into the water without any exception.
 Yook Dae Rang, who had lived the longest among the Hundred Experts, was dragged into the pit of the Yangtze River first.
 Eopu, eopu! Zhuge Zak floundered.
 Grab this! A warrior of the Murim Association that was near him brought a plank and extended it to Zhuge Zak.
 It was a broken part of the ship.
 The water current is not fast, fortunately!
Zhuge Sang yelled while entrusting his body to the ship fragment.
 Go to that rock! Gu Pung pointed at one point while swimming.
 It was a place where a rock, the size of a house was lined up.
 They could see that it was connected with land.
 It was a really fortunate thing.
 The group relied on each other and climbed the big rock.
 Cough, cough! Are all of you safe? None of you got hurt? Gu Pung raised his voice while coughing.
 He searched for the members of the Lotus Peak first.</p>
<p>The first one that entered his eyes was Jang Seo Eun.
 Se, senior uncle! Jang Seo Eun yelled urgently with a pale face.
 The reason her face was pale wasnt only because the water was cold.
 I, I cant see younger brother! What…? Gu Pungs complexion changed and he checked his surroundings.
 He was able to see Jang Hong and Jang Seo Eun but he wasnt able to see Ju Seo Cheon.
 He checked thoroughly as he may be hanging on another rock but he couldnt even see a hair.
 Seung Kye! Next to him, the voice of the anxious Zhuge Sang was heard.
 His eyes were also rolling busily and his complexion wasnt good either.
 Seung Kye, answer me if you are near! Seung Kye! Zhuge Sangs heart breaking voice rang out.
 This cant be… Gu Pung couldnt believe it.
 Ju Seo Cheon and Zhuge Seung Kye.
 Only those two were nowhere to be seen.</p></div>

<p>138 Part 2.<br />
They are the cracked magic stone of the Diarma and a magic stone of an SS class dragon.<br />
Is it alright to put something like that in.<br />
This is a skill to create a new dragon species by fusing magic stones.<br />
If the skill works, it will follow me, and the class will be at least S class.<br />
However, the fact that there were no changes was what unnerved me.<br />
Since the time needed for fusing per class differ, it would take a long time, but it still was too long.  </p>
<p>The side effect is monsters coming after me, but I did not expect that.<br />
If the dragon is born, does the wound heal.<br />
No, it remains the same.<br />
Don’t use the skill anymore.<br />
Yoohyun was firm.<br />
But it’s a shame not to use it, and having a scar won’t bother me.<br />
I want to remove that right now if I could.<br />
My little brother muttered to take better care of myself and picked a steamed shishito pepper with his chopsticks.<br />
Yoohyun stopped moving after taking a bite as I looked at him with some anticipation.<br />
Isn’t it tasty.<br />
Y.<br />
.<br />
es.<br />
Myungwoo made it.<br />
Huh.<br />
Yoohyun spoke in a sour voice.<br />
He refused my offer of bringing some of Myungwoo’s side dishes but might have changed his opinion now.  </p>
<p>Taste other dishes and tell me if they suit you.<br />
I’ll have them refilled.<br />
No, it’s all right.<br />
Yoohyun’s voice seemed irritated, and he only ate the eggs and ignored the other dishes afterward.<br />
Why? What was wrong with the dishes?.<br />
Don’t be picky.<br />
I gave him my eggs and thought I should bring other side dishes, maybe some laver.  </p>
<p>My fear resistance class is a C right now.<br />
What.<br />
Taewon Song had a skill that could lower the class level of another skill.<br />
I felt bad for Taewon Song, but I needed to tell Yoohyun this so his skill level would not be lowered by it.<br />
If the skill lasted half a day for an A class, it would last at least an hour for an S class.<br />
If a resistance skill’s class level fell, it might be dangerous.  </p>
<p>I’m surprised that there’s a skill like that, with that sort of effect.<br />
That’s because I shared the skill that multiplies the attack skill effect by two.<br />
Normally the level decreases by three classes, so be careful as an S class skill will become a C class.<br />
Since it applies by long contact, you would not be affected by the skill during battle.<br />
Stop sharing skills.<br />
You know it’s dangerous.<br />
I’m going to write a contract and then share now.<br />
I would have to modify it, though.<br />
My little brother cleaned after we finished our breakfast.<br />
He really is kind and sweet.<br />
Why was he not in a relationship? Was he too perfect? [Last night, the dungeon break that occurred in OO mountain in Gangseo-gu, Seoul… There was a special program about the dungeon break that occurred last night when I turned on the TV.<br />
Except for regular programs, everyone was talking about the dungeon break, and there was nothing about me.<br />
It was probable since it had been a long time since the last dungeon break.<br />
‘It has not ended yet.<br />
’ Someone intentionally broke the dungeon, and if this information was revealed, then it was like jumping into fire doused in oil.<br />
Why are they hanging themselves with the rope of salvation I gave them instead of retiring peacefully.<br />
I have to backtrack the honey on the market and select those who did not reply to me.<br />
A smart move would be telling me that retirement was forthcoming.<br />
The first thing I needed to do was to track the honey, and unfortunately, the only person I could think of was Hyunjae Sung.<br />
com ‘’There have to be hunters in Sesung who can gain information from people or corpses.<br />
Since they took the corpse in Hong Kong, it was definite.<br />
I did not want to ask Yerim to do it, and anyway, it would be too late since coming out of the dungeon would take at least a week to ten days.<br />
What should I give him? Should I offer him my information about magic stone combinations? He would find a customized riding beast an attractive idea.<br />
‘It’s difficult to find a high-class electricity resistant monster.<br />
’ The beast needed to be an S class for the Sesung guild master, and I would not offer him this for tracking the honey transaction route.<br />
I would only give him information that it might be possible since I did not know if the skill would succeed and the extent I could combine monsters.<br />
It seemed like a fraud, but Hyunjae Sung could afford it if he had so much.<br />
Yoohyun had come out of the kitchen and glanced at the TV.<br />
He then sat down on the sofa.  </p>
<p>Aren’t you going to the guild? They will be bustling because of the dungeon break.<br />
I’m still in the dungeon on all accounts.<br />
Since it would do no good if people knew I came out using a gate stone, I’m laying low until the dungeon conquest is complete.<br />
You’ll also be staying at home until your fear resistance skill is restored, right?I avoided Yoohyun’s confident gaze.<br />
com for the best novel reading experience.<br />
No, I need to keep busy.<br />
It’s evident that the dungeon break is to cover me, and I need to do something about it.<br />
Also, you don’t need fear resistance to go about daily routines.<br />
A C class is more than enough as civilians don’t have them at all.<br />
People will say that a C class skill is more than enough.<br />
My brother’s expression turned annoyed, and I was sorry to make him housekeep, but he could use the rest.  </p>
<p>Then, I’ll go along with you.<br />
Wasn’t the Hayeon guild master participating in a dungeon conquest?Yoohyun phoned somewhere instead of replying.<br />
A moment later, Simyeong Seok came in dragging a man in his early twenties.  </p>
<p>Weren’t you in a dungeon now?It was Minyui Kim, a Haeyeon B class hunter who recommended a pub for Sunghan Kim before.<br />
Yoohyun smiled warmly as Minyui Kim stared at him with surprised eyes.  </p>
<p>Let me borrow your identity for a week.<br />
Since you’re on vacation, you don’t need it.<br />
You took a leave too.<br />
I took it to go on a Europe trip.<br />
Yoohyun picked up glasses while he gazed at Minyui Kim, stepping away from him.<br />
Simyeong Seok put forth a pill in front of him.  </p>
<p>You only need to sleep and wake up.<br />
I reserved the plane tickets and the hotel already.<br />
We will compensate three times the amount and extend your leave.<br />
Minyui Kim complained but still accepted the pill.<br />
I am sorry, but do not worry.<br />
I will try my best to prevent my brother from causing a racket.  </p>

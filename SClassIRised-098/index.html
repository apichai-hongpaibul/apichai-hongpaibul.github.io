<p>&lt; Traditional Play (2) .<br />
I started to wonder what we were going to do, seeing a picnic basket come out of the car trunk.<br />
Did we really come over to play? But I noticed Noah being quite excited and shut my mouth.<br />
Right, well, it wasn’t like you had to take only convenient food to dungeons.<br />
Of course, it was expected to be about two days, so we packed other things, too.<br />
Holding the picnic basket, Sung Hyunjae took out a white coat and slipped it on.<br />
It was an unrealistically clean white coat that wasn’t fabric or leather.<br />
It was equipment that that person was using, so it was probably at least S-Rank.<br />
On the other hand, Noah’s V-neck T-shirt, pants, and a short robe cardigan that wasn’t in our world’s style, were all B-Rank.<br />
Of course, it wasn’t that Noah didn’t have S-Rank equipment.<br />
He also had a sleek racing suit with good options, but the problem was the whole body beast transformation.<br />
I used all my memory power and remembered the method for special processing for entire body beast transformation, but the materials were lacking.<br />
Specifically, the materials for the special processing of A-Rank and higher equipment.<br />
I put out a search for the materials so it wouldn’t be far before I found them, but comparing him with Sung Hyunjae, I became pointlessly sorry.<br />
In addition, I was in normal clothes of course.<br />
I packed Mana and Mental equipment, but clothing options were mainly defense, so as a stat F, if it was an A-Rank dungeon, I would go to the grave with one blow without much difference whether I wore them or not.<br />
Should I say it’s like spreading a newspaper to block the rain in the middle of a tempest? If they had high rank skills besides resistance types added, then they would be usable, but those were rare.<br />
And if high rank equipment with skills appeared, I should give it to the guys going around dungeons first – it was a waste for me to use.<br />
‘I want to get Yerim a full set of S-Ranks.<br />
’ Sunghan-ssi also needed to upgrade his equipment.<br />
As expected, imploring Myeongwoo would be the fastest way.<br />
Though before that, he would need to finish whatever he was making now.  </p>
<p>While we are here, it would be good to try practicing combat in your whole body beast transformation form.<br />
They were low grade A-Rank monsters, so they were decent for practice.<br />
But going off, leaving Yoojin-ssi…Noah trailed off, peeking at Sung Hyunjae.<br />
At the gaze full of wariness, Sung Hyunjae smirked.  </p>
<p>To think that you think you can protect him if you stay by his side.<br />
You’re self-confident.<br />
At the openly provoking words, Noah’s eyes fiercened.<br />
I mean, Noah was an S-Rank in his own way, but, um… It was annoying, but that Sung Hyunjae was stronger than Yoohyun.<br />
Until his whereabouts became unknown, he was rooted to 1st place in the ranking competitions.  </p>
<p>It is okay, Noah-ssi.<br />
Even if that person talks like that, he will not harm me.<br />
Do you think that you can trust the Seseong Guild Leader.<br />
Rather than trusting, I think that he would not do something that would be of a loss to himself.<br />
He wasn’t a man who would dig this kind of simple trap either.<br />
Noah hesitated and then nodded his head.<br />
When I took the chance to use the My Brat skill, the growth speed was applied doubled to +200%.<br />
On top of that, the standby time for reuse was also cut in half to 15 days.<br />
…Couldn’t that Yoohyun somehow get a curse and poison dragon type transformation skill? It was really good.<br />
Anyways, Sung Hyunjae, that person, really.<br />
Is it fun to to deride much younger kids, as an adult.<br />
Aren’t I leaving him alone, physically fine, like an adult? Though it’s an honor that Han Yoojin-gun thinks of me as a good adult.<br />
At Sung Hyunjae’s words, I realized my mistake.<br />
Even though he treated me lightly, jokingly, he wasn’t really that kind of person.<br />
There wasn’t much of a reason for him to be treat Noah, who had basically stabbed him in the back and ran away, tolerantly.<br />
On top of that, if he had even bared his teeth like just a while ago, then even more so.  </p>
<p>I would like to request for you to at least pretend to be a good adult in this dungeon.<br />
Whose request is it that I would refuse? I’ll try.<br />
Don’t laugh pretending to be nice, I’ll grow fond.<br />
Just in case, I should avoid leaving Noah and Sung Hyunjae alone together.<br />
We were going to go into the dungeon building, but someone came over.<br />
It was a man in his early thirties with a chilly expression.<br />
No, rather than an expression, the glint in his eyes towards me was cold.<br />
‘It’s also been a while since I’ve received that kind of gaze.<br />
’ Lately, everyone was only kind.<br />
Noah was also directing it towards Riette; it wasn’t that he had discontent toward me.<br />
He somehow became friendly, so I smiled back at the man, the Soodam Guild Leader Yoon Kyeongsoo.<br />
I had wanted to meet you once, so I am pleased that we were able to happen across each other like this.<br />
At my greeting, Yoon Kyeongsoo smiled at least with his mouth.  </p>
<p>I should have gone to find you first, but I apologize that my greeting is late.<br />
So, I wondered why he didn’t contact me.<br />
The following conversation was formally normal.<br />
Since it was a dungeon under Soodam’s management, there was some related talk, and there were inquiries about this and that, and he wished for us to finish the attack safely.<br />
In other words, the contents weren’t ones that a guild leader should talk about after coming all the way here.<br />
Though it could’ve been that he was so free that he wanted to take a walk or something.<br />
We decided that Noah would go into the dungeon first and take care of the surroundings.<br />
When I was left alone with Sung Hyunjae, I asked about the thing I was curious about right away.  </p>
<p>It seems like the Soodam Guild Leader has a lot of discontent towards Haeyeon?I couldn’t think of a reason to show hostility towards me, other than Yoohyun.<br />
Since the current me was quietly raising monsters under the protection of giant guilds.<br />
And I haven’t ever contacted Soodam once.<br />
There wasn’t much of a reason for an S-Rank Hunter to have negative feelings toward a stat F who had a good skill to use.<br />
So it would be right to think that he had discontent toward, not me, but my guardian.<br />
It was Yoon Kyeongsoo who looked down on the young master first.<br />
And then he was bitten harshly.<br />
Then isn’t it the consequences of his own actions? He seems to be more narrow-minded than he looks.<br />
The young master is so young that his pride was probably hurt.<br />
Yoon Kyeongsoo also approached, trying to stand on his own in his own way, but then became a stepping stone and was pushed out, so it’s enough for him to grind his teeth.<br />
He should be thinking that Han Yoohyun snatched his spot? Even so, he can only grind his teeth.<br />
Did he mean that, he tried to use the young and so seemingly easy Yoohyun in order to try to make his guild on his own, unlike Breaker or MKC, and then it went the opposite way?.<br />
It is interesting that Yoohyun sent me here without saying much.<br />
It was that he didn’t say much to Han Yoojin-gun – he already went one round.<br />
And in the kidnapping case last time, he caught and held Soodam like catching a mouse just in case.<br />
Is that so? He is also an S-Rank Hunter, so it seems like the resistance would be harsh… Would there be anything becoming a threat to Haeyeon?There wasn’t much of a problem before the regression.<br />
But now, there was me, so Yoohyun’s attitude would’ve changed considerably.<br />
Since the kidnapping, and going to the dungeon this time, were things that didn’t originally occur.<br />
So there was enough possibility that with excessive suppression, different from before, Yoon Kyeongsoo would attack Haeyeon, Yoohyun, with a malicious heart.<br />
com When I turned to look at my side at the lengthening silence, I was met with a gaze that seemed to be observing me closely.  </p>
<p>Why are you looking at me like that.<br />
Because it’s fascinating.<br />
There sure were a lot of things to be fascinated about.<br />
It must be fun for him to live.  </p>
<p>It isn’t that easy for a dog that has yielded and turned its belly inside out, to bare its teeth again.<br />
Unless something supports it so that it definitely has a chance at victory, it’ll be quiet.<br />
It’s because he knows that well, that the young master is also leaving Yoon Kyeongsoo alive.<br />
So is that why we purposely came to a dungeon affiliated to Soodam? Because you thought he might have joined hands with something that would support him?Bait and so forth, and going to a dungeon affiliated to a different guild.<br />
On top of that, the headcount was low.<br />
If there was someone aiming for us, it would be like waving a traffic safety baton telling them to not miss this chance and attack.<br />
Of course, it was two S-Rank Hunters, so it was ambiguous to say it was little, but it probably meant that the opponent had about that level of combat power.<br />
This really could get dangerous.<br />
But I had given the bead to Noah, and Sung Hyunjae would probably do well on his own.<br />
Since he wasn’t someone who would act without any thought.  </p>
<p>It could be that, and it could not be.<br />
If nothing much happens today, we should go to MKC next time.<br />
And check Hanshin and Breaker.<br />
Haeyeon, as I know, is definitely not it.<br />
com for the best novel reading experience …Let’s end it with Soodam, please.<br />
After about ten minutes, we went into the gate.<br />
This time, a greeting message window didn’t pop up.<br />
Where they planning on not intervening normally, since they had made my exclusive dungeon? Under the blue sky, extensive grasslands were spread out.<br />
The gold dragon that was crossing across the blindingly clear blue sky turned his body and landed in front of me.<br />
The landing motion was definitely more skilled than before.<br />
The light miasma that was surrounding the golden body slowly disappeared.<br />
-I have handled all the monsters nearby.  </p>
<p>You have worked hard.<br />
The light gray eyes became slits and he smiled.<br />
Since it was his dragon appearance, I felt like I should pet his head as a way of telling him he did well.<br />
And scratch his neck a little, too.<br />
Comet liked being rubbed between its horns – would Noah be like that too?.<br />
There’s no need to take care of all the monsters on the 1st floor, so first, let’s move toward the lake.<br />
It’s not that far from the gate.<br />
Sung Hyunjae said.<br />
And then he went toward Noah as if it was natural.  </p>
<p>It seems like it would be difficult for Noah-ssi to take two people.<br />
com for a better experience.<br />
You’re thinking too lightly of a dragon type.<br />
He can hold monsters that are three to four times his size and fly up, so don’t worry.<br />
I just meant that I didn’t want to make Noah let you ride on him, but you were being like that even while knowing that.<br />
Noah-ssi, I am sorry.<br />
Please endure it just this once.<br />
*** The gate that was still in the active state was emitting a blue light.<br />
There were more than about twenty minutes before it closed.<br />
People started to come, one or two at a time, into the quiet space where there were only the faint bursts of sound from the gate’s energy.<br />
They were Hunters centered around MKC’s guild leader Choi Sukwon and Soodam’s guild leader Yoon Kyeongsoo.<br />
There were fifteen Hunters, who were all A-Rank or higher, excluding the healers and assistance types.<br />
Since there were two S-Rank Hunters added to that, it was combat power that could easily attack any existing dungeon.<br />
Despite that, there was a thick tension in the people’s faces.<br />
S-Rank Hunter Choi Sukwon didn’t really seem like he could completely hide his anxiety.  </p>
<p>To think that I would fight with Sung Hyunjae again like this.<br />
During the time when dungeon breaks were frequent, combat between Hunters in break regions were frequent.<br />
Since the number of S-Rank Hunters were small, the cases of them fighting each other were rare, but it wasn’t that it didn’t happen.<br />
And Choi Sukwon had fought with Sung Hyunjae before.<br />
The fight wasn’t that long, and Choi Sukwon had definitely lost.<br />
Having felt that he couldn’t bridge the gap, he didn’t go at Sung Hyunjae again a second time.<br />
Sung Hyunjae and Han Yoohyun, as well as Moon Hyuna.<br />
Those three guys are definitely crazy.<br />
Choi Sukwon mumbled pointlessly.<br />
Especially the latter two were famous for actively going out to find opponents to pick fights with.<br />
Sung Hyunjae, at that, didn’t come out much from his territory, but you couldn’t know when and where you would unluckily meet Han Yoohyun or Moon Hyuna.<br />
Of course, they were competitive with each other, too.<br />
Maybe because A-Ranks and lower were boring, they didn’t touch them, but against other S-Ranks, there would be no disaster that could match up to that.<br />
It was to the point that there was nonsense said, asking if it was a problem of having the ‘hyun’ syllable in their name.  </p>
<p>Are you frightened already? How pathetic.<br />
At Yoon Kyeongsoo’s snide remark, Choi Sukwon didn’t lose either and sneered back.  </p>
<p>It’s better than not being able to move in front a guy ten years younger and only glancing at him.<br />
Shut it.<br />
You’re scared enough that all you can do is suck your thumb[1 even if a stat F defenselessly passes in front of you.<br />
That’s why Han Yoohyun left Soodam alone.<br />
There was the sound of teeth grinding.<br />
His face was chaotically contorted, but Yoon Kyeongsoo didn’t reply more and glared at the gate.<br />
Like Choi Sukwon said, he was completely suppressed by Han Yoohyun.<br />
A young kid who had luckily Awakened as S-Rank.<br />
Ever since that short evaluation turned into fear, he only suppressed it while not being able to dream of rebelling.<br />
If I cut off the fingers of the family he cherishes one by one and send it to him, that guy’s face would be worth looking at.<br />
I’m already looking forward to it.<br />
You should’ve been told not to kill him.<br />
Isn’t it that he just needs to be breathing? Seeing him directly, he looks more like Han Yoohyun than I expected.<br />
So even more-.<br />
Yoon Kyeongwoo couldn’t finish his words, and crossed his arms, raising them up in front of his face.<br />
Puuk!.<br />
Ugh!A sharp kick nailed down on the reflexive guard.<br />
He blocked it with a perfect pose, but Yoon Kyeongsoo felt a powerful pain as he was pushed back.<br />
Gold eyes filled with a scornful sneer stared at him being like that.  </p>
<p>Feeble things.<br />
Lowering the leg she had raised, Riette clicked her tongue.<br />
If you’re scared of an opponent stronger than you, you should stay shut up in a corner like that – you’re thinking of taking your anger out on the wrong person? How can you be so pathetic? And you must have gone around stiff-necked, barely as an S-Rank combat Hunter.<br />
Why don’t you just cut off your thing? Hm.<br />
……Shit.<br />
Yoon Kyeongsoo ground his teeth and fiercely glared at Riette, but it was just that.<br />
It was an opponent that he couldn’t even properly sense approaching.<br />
On top of that, even with just one bout, he could clearly feel the difference in strength.<br />
He wouldn’t be able to easily lunge at her at other times, but this moment was even more of a time to not fight.<br />
At that man’s appearance, Riette lowered the tips of her mouth as if it was boring.  </p>
<p>Ah really, so not fun.<br />
How did I get to joining up with these boring guys.<br />
”Advertisements She roughly ruffled the back of her head, and then sighed.  </p>
<p>Thanks for sending the private plane, MKC.<br />
No problem.<br />
Thanks for coming[2.<br />
Unlike Yoon Kyeongsoo, Choi Sukwon stared at Riette with a much more relieved expression.<br />
He thought now it was fairly doable.<br />
com Riette turned around and walked toward the gate.  </p>
<p>Alright, let’s quickly go and end this.<br />
We can’t make my darling wait for long.<br />
She stepped into the dungeon first, and the remaining people disappeared one by one into the gate.<br />
Indoors was locked in silence again, and the gate became inactive faster than expected.<br />

<p>Chapter 139 A Shard Within (1).<br />
With only a B class hunter as your bodyguard, there might be a third attempt to kidnap you today.<br />
Yoohyun laughed while he respectfully held an umbrella over my head.<br />
He would look like Hunter Minyui Kim to other people.  </p>
<p>If there are people who try to take such a foolish chance, I’ll burn their roots as a welcome.<br />
So please don’t worry.<br />
You’re a dependable person like my brother.<br />
I walked along while trying to stifle my laughter.<br />
Other hunters worried over me and continued to ask if I was all right with only a B class hunter as I went to the parking lot.  </p>
<p>Hunter Minyui Kim is more than enough.<br />
The hunters looked at Yoohyun with surprised eyes.<br />
While Minyui Kim had a useful skill, he was only a B class supporter who had officially met me for the first time.<br />
It would be strange for me to trust him.<br />
However, I did not want to be indifferent to him and thought it would be useful to raise Minyui’s value.<br />
After all, I was the person to be connected with nowadays.<br />
Minyui Kim’s car was a small and yellow foreign compact model, and his novice driver sign had a character on it.<br />
com for a better experience.<br />
Even his air freshener is cute.<br />
There was a famous children’s character mini-doll hanging on one side.<br />
I wondered whether kids nowadays liked this sort of thing, and remembering Yoohyun’s bleak car saddened me a little.  </p>
<p>Do you have a hobby.<br />
A hobby? No.<br />
Yoohyun replied while turning on the engine.  </p>
<p>You really don’t have anything you want to do and the like.<br />
I didn’t have time to think of such things.<br />
Yoohyun’s quiet reply made me think my question was an unnecessary one.<br />
However, my brother might have the time to find a hobby if his surroundings allowed it in the future.<br />
He should not become Hyunjae Sung or Riette.<br />
There were not any S classes from birth that would serve as a suitable example, and I might have to count on the other two.<br />
‘I have to search for them anyway.<br />
Please let them be the right people.<br />
com My life was already going crazy, and I needed a break now.<br />
Riette would appear soon, and I might have to meet her with my lowered fear resistance.<br />
The thought made my head spin.<br />
I first replaced my broken cell phone.<br />
While the television and the Internet moved on to new issues, people inside and outside of the communication service branch store [still recognized who I was.<br />
A grandmother held my hand and told me I had gone through much trouble.<br />
I had my USIM chip replaced in embarrassment and called our dear Sesung Guild Leader after getting back to the car.<br />
However, he did not answer for once.<br />
Was he busy? I called him again to no avail, so I changed tactics and tried to get Soyoung Kang on the phone.<br />
[Hello, Mr.<br />
Yoojin Han!.<br />
Hello, Ms.<br />
Soyoung.<br />
Do you know where Sesung Guild Leader is? He’s not answering the phone.<br />
[Guild Leader is um, officially conquering a dungeon right now.  </p>
<p>I met him last night.<br />
The association lapped it up since they wanted the credit, and yesterday’s processing of the dungeon break was said to be by association hunters headed by Taewon Song on television.<br />
I had not seen another hunter, although it would have been bothersome if they had come even though they had been notified that an S class monster appeared.<br />
There was no healer present anyway.<br />
com [Oh, you did.<br />
I did not know that because you were not mentioned.<br />
It’s no surprise since when our Guild Leader moves without prior notice nowadays, his actions have to do something with you on a 99% average.<br />
Was I that bad? I did act on a whim often, and someone like Hyunjae Sung would move on a planned schedule.<br />
[Would you come to the guild? I’ll get in touch with him.  </p>
<p>Yes, thank you.<br />
We should tie up the ends as soon as possible.<br />
I called Taewon Song after I ended the phone, but he did not answer.<br />
He probably was still unable to replace his phone, as his cards would have become unusable.  </p>
<p>Let’s go to Sesung.<br />
I know we are not up to their level, but I’m still pissed off.<br />
I wish you wouldn’t have to go there.<br />
Yoohyun turned the handle while he continued to grumble.<br />
While Haeyeon Guild would match Sesung regarding domestic dungeon conquering abilities when we assembled an S class team with Yerim, we were still far behind in other fields.<br />
Of course, a guild founded by a teenager going this far was an impressive feat in itself.  </p>
<p>You’re only twenty.<br />
How can a minor who started from scratch catch up to an adult who already carved his place in society in such a short time? I heard that the Sesung Guild Leader was going places even before his awakening.<br />
I know that he did not have any trouble with funds.<br />
Do you know what he did?I had no personal interest regarding Hyunjae Sung, but I was curious.<br />
Did he really have foreign blood in him? He would have stood out before awakening as a hunter if he had lived in Korea.<br />
Since I did not have any information, there was a high possibility of him having been abroad.  </p>
<p>I don’t know, and I have no reason to know.<br />
I can’t say to be on friendly terms with him as he is also an S class hunter, but he is a good business associate.<br />
He was special, and Yoohyun could learn how to be a better guild leader.  </p>
<p>Don’t become friends.<br />
You might pick up something bad.<br />
I’m not friends with him.<br />
Yeah, Ms.<br />
Hyuna Moon would be the best bet to be friends within the guild leaders.<br />
Noah and Ms.<br />
Soyoung would make good friends.<br />
It’s best to be friends with someone your age, and you should ignore old men.<br />
com I felt better when I thought of them in the same place, including Yerim.<br />
It was a fresh and comforting sight.  </p>
<p>When we finish up this.<br />
It was then Yoohyun reached out to me with his hand.<br />
A longsword burst out and ripped my seatbelt.<br />
The blade spun over my head to penetrate the car door and became embedded on the road.<br />
Then I heard a loud screeching noise of tires hitting the ground, and something crashed into the yellow compact car.<br />
At the same time, Yoohyun’s sword absorbed the impact of the crash and struck out at the car that had hit us.<br />
I saw a large truck split in two through the cut car door.<br />
Yoohyun Han grabbed me with one arm and obliterated the swinging car door and jumped outside.<br />
I saw how chaotic the road had become when we landed on the collapsed truck that had been diagonally cut in two.  </p>
<p>Things become insane so quickly.<br />
I was still flabbergasted, but I was sure that the truck had tried to crush the small car.<br />
It had even targeted the passenger seat, and I had to sigh over the fact this happened the moment I came out with a B class hunter.<br />
The real Minyui Kim was a supporter who would not have been able to protect me properly.<br />
Since I had not been using the grace, I would have at least been seriously hurt, and maybe die on the spot if things had turned out badly.  </p>
<p>I know that it was an opportunity hard to ignore, but these guys act fast.<br />
They must have been lying in wait, and my heart began to beat faster due to my lowered fear resistance.<br />
I called Haeyeon instead of Yoohyun, who was searching the truck driver.<br />
I asked them to process the accident and a new car and turned my gaze back to the road.<br />
The driver’s dead.<br />
He is? Yoohyun, I mean, Mr.<br />
Minyui Kim, please help the people still trapped in their cars.<br />
Many cars were swept into this accident because of the size of the truck.<br />
Yoohyun looked like he did not want to do it, but he ran down when I told him I would turn on the grace.<br />
He suddenly came back with an umbrella.  </p>
<p>Stay still, so you’re in clear sight.<br />
He opened the umbrella and made me hold it before going to an overturned car.<br />
I did not care if I got wet; it was summer.<br />
The road situation was soon remedied after Yoohyun began to work.<br />
He easily ripped the dented car doors and rescued others.<br />
I thought it might be dangerous to move the injured, but Yoohyun used mid-class potions whenever necessary.<br />
He pushed the cars blocking the road and made way for the ambulances to come in.<br />
119 and the police came soon, and there was low class awakened mixed in the ambulance workers.<br />
While there were no high-class awakened, there were more than ten mid-class awakened who worked as firefighters around the country.<br />
Most of them had awakened in accident sites and chose to work as firefighters instead of hunters.  </p>
<p>Thank you, hunter.<br />
I appreciate your efforts.<br />
Yoohyun exchanged words with the ambulance workers and returned to my side.<br />
His question rang quietly in my ear as we shared the umbrella.<br />
Who might it be? The association.<br />
The auction house might be involved since they would have some grudges against us.<br />
They both had it coming.<br />
However, wouldn’t the auction house still find some value in keeping us alive.<br />
They wiped the entire hotel.<br />
Someone wants revenge.<br />
Yoohyun made me promise that at least an A class, and preferably an S class hunter would accompany me.<br />
Later on, people from the Haeyeon Guild and the hunter accident department arrived.<br />
I did not see Taewon Song around because it was a simple car accident.<br />
Haeyeon decided to collect the driver’s corpse first after negotiations.<br />
I had not seen Hunter Sunghan Kim for a while, and he now approached us.  </p>
<p>Hello, Mr.<br />
Sunghan.<br />
Are you hurt?Sunghan Kim did not say anything after I answered I was not hurt in any way and just took out the driver’s corpse.<br />
While he was friendly and showed his worry, his attitude towards me was more indifferent than before.<br />
com for a better experience ‘He had not sent me any medicine or other gifts recently.<br />
’ I looked up my status page and saw Sunghan Kim’s name was still recorded there.<br />
However, there was a definite change in his attitude towards me.  </p>
<p>Mr.<br />
Sunghan Kim.<br />
I called him as I got off the truck with Yoohyun’s help.  </p>
<p>Yes.<br />
Do you remember saying that I reminded you of your grandfather before.<br />
Ah…yes I did.<br />
Sunghan Kim looked a bit embarrassed as he nodded.  </p>
<p>I apologize for surprising you with ungrounded words.<br />
com If he was saying that he was sorry, that would mean only one thing.  </p>
<p>You don’t think that anymore.<br />
Yes.<br />
I still think there are similar points, but you two are completely different people.<br />
He answered, without any hesitation.<br />
So, he was saying that we were completely different people now? ‘Was the effect that made him think I was his temporary caretaker?’ However, Yerim, Peace, and the chick acted in the same manner to me.<br />
The difference between them and Sunghan Kim was that I had been neglecting the latter.<br />
The attention had been one way, and we had not met often and had not seen each other recently.<br />
‘So, even if the keyword effect helps me temporarily, I have to work on relationships afterward.<br />
’ It would be too much to receive one-way affection because of a keyword, even if it was an L class title.<br />
The effect seemed to have lasted about two months when I calculated the last time Sunghan Kim sent me presents.<br />
Did others experience a little change? Yoohyun was my brother with or without that title, so I would have to ask Yerim when she comes out.<br />
com ‘I would have to pay more attention to Ms.<br />
Hyuna.<br />
’ I would have to get closer to her before the keyword effect wore out.<br />
I apologized to Minyui Kim silently for his lost car and arrived at Sesung Guild in a new one.<br />
Soyoung Kang met me and opened her eyes wide when she thought she saw Minyui Kim with me.  </p>
<p>This is the first time I met you.<br />
This is Minyui Kim, a B class hunter in Haeyeon Guild.<br />
A B class hunter? Mr.<br />
Han, are you craz-why are you being so careless?.<br />
I trust him.<br />
Where is Sesung Guild Leader.<br />
Please step this way.<br />
Soyoung Kang glanced at Yoohyun with distrust and led us in.<br />
We were inspected and given inventory seal bracelets to wear, but the inside of the building was heavily guarded.<br />
Soyoung Kang stopped walking.  </p>
<p>I’m sorry to say that a Haeyeon hunter cannot go on further.<br />
com Yoohyun immediately frowned when he heard her words, but Soyoung Kang did not step back.<br />
She told him again that outside parties cannot enter with a rare determination and coldness in her expression.  </p>
<p>Mr.<br />
Minyui Kim, please wait here.<br />
But I cannot leave him alone.<br />
I’m not alone.<br />
Ms.<br />
Soyoung Kang is here, and maybe others.<br />
Something like a little lizard.<br />
I stepped closer to Yoohyun as if to calm him and lightly held his hand.<br />
Irin came over to my hand in the space we kept hidden from Soyoung Kang’s sight.<br />
Irin went to my shoulder and began to rest as a tattoo.  </p>
<p>Please wait in comfort.<br />
Yes, take care.<br />
If there is any danger, let’s go with eleven.<br />
Yoohyun must be talking about the contract leftover from the Hong Kong kidnapping.<br />
What was eleven? I should check the memo later.<br />
I affectionately tapped Yoohyun’s shoulder and followed Soyoung Kang to step inside.<br />
Our Guild Leader seemed to be in a bad mood this morning.<br />
Soyoung Kang opened her mouth when only the two of us were left.  </p>
<p>He may have had a nightmare or have other thoughts in his mind.<br />
He said to let you in if you wanted to come, but his voice was off.<br />
Soyoung Kang took out a compact portal key, telling me to be careful today.  </p>

<p>&lt; Greeting (1) .  </p>
<p>It is nice to meet you, Hunter Yoo Myeongwoo-nim.<br />
You are much cooler in person.<br />
Please tell us what to do, whatever it is! Do you have any materials you require?There were excited noises from all directions.<br />
When Myeongwoo, who had been secluding himself at home for a long time, finally showed himself, all Hunters within the building swarmed over.<br />
The mid to low rank Hunters couldn’t easily intrude, so at first, it was a little over ten people, but people heard the news and streamed in, so over thirty A-Rank Hunters filled the lobby.<br />
From time to time, I also saw faces I met at Haeyeon.<br />
Only Hunters who had permission to enter could come into the inner lobby, so I thought there might be more outside.<br />
All of them had S-Rank equipment in their sights, so they were impatient.<br />
Myeongwoo was a little taken aback at first, but soon, confidently picked out volunteers to boss around in order to shop for materials.<br />
Seeing A-Rank Hunters being bossed around by the fingertip[1 felt pleasing.<br />
Our Myeongwoo was completely a boss among bosses.  </p>
<p>Then, I’ll be back.<br />
Be careful going around.<br />
Safety is number one.<br />
com Though, he had Shalos’ Bead and could dodge into the Forge if need be, so there probably wouldn’t be any problems.<br />
When Myeongwoo left, most of the people followed after him.<br />
But a few stayed and turned their attention to me with eyes that said something was better than nothing.<br />
Just then, Yerim appeared from the entrance connected to the parking lot.<br />
She was still young and her outward appearance didn’t look that strong, but the surrounding Hunters knew to get out of her way.<br />
Without anybody blocking her path, Yerim walked lightly over to me and smiled brightly.  </p>
<p>Ahjussi~ oh? It’s a bracelet I haven’t seen before.<br />
It’s pretty! But it doesn’t seem to suit your clothes.<br />
Ahjussi, get proper styling, too.<br />
That’s annoying to do.<br />
It wasn’t like I went on air and needed to manage my image like guild leaders, so for what? Yerim, who had been staring at the bracelet, searched around me.  </p>
<p>It looks like Noah oppa isn’t here.<br />
Why? Do you need to see him for something.<br />
No, he’s just pretty.<br />
And he sparkles.<br />
Ah, did you know? Soyoung unni came to see Comet and saw Noah oppa practicing flight, and was stunned the whole day.<br />
Even now, she mumbles ‘I can’t, I have Comet’ at the drop of a hat.<br />
It seems like he was really appealing to her.<br />
It made sense for that to happen.<br />
Comet was also going to grow up to be an S-Rank dragon type, but it couldn’t compare to Noah.<br />
Though of course, Noah was a person.<br />
No, was it better because he was a person, so communication worked? I wanted to show Riette once to Kang Soyoung, too.<br />
I was getting curious over her reaction.<br />
com for a better experience.<br />
You said you are going to the special isolation center, right.<br />
Yeah.<br />
Though you don’t have to come along.<br />
The atmosphere was going to be different from the detention center, so it was bit much to take a kid.<br />
But Yerim raised her eyebrows as if asking what I was talking about.  </p>
<p>While I’m here, I’m ahjussi’s bodyguard.<br />
That’s how we made the contract.<br />
After decursing the contract with Yerim that was annulled during the kidnapping, I tried to not make a new contract.<br />
It was because I thought that there probably wasn’t a need to bind her with a contract.<br />
Since she was a kid who would try to help me even without something like that.<br />
But Yerim wanted to draw a contract up again, and this time we decided on a condition where she would protect me when I called for her.<br />
While I looked down at Yerim, who would follow me wherever it was, I suddenly noticed the earrings shaking on her ears.<br />
‘It was called the Mermaid Queen of Sea Waves Earrings, right?’ It was definitely a design similar to Water Droplet’s, the mermaid queen’s, earrings.<br />
Specifically, just the size of those blue gems were different, but they seemed to be the same mineral.<br />
I didn’t have the ability to accurately distinguish between them, but the color and the cutting were completely the same.<br />
‘If Myeongwoo could teach his skill to other people with the talent, then it would probably be possible for the immoral people, too.<br />
com If it was true that those earrings were Water Droplet’s, then her skills would be water-, ice-affiliated.<br />
What abilities would the others have? I didn’t know about Newcomer, and Deer, Wolf, Tree.<br />
…I really couldn’t tell.<br />
There was Water Droplet, so why wasn’t there something like Flame? Anyways, I should extort out all that I could extort out.  </p>
<p>I also have to meet Yoohyun, but for some reason there’s no reply.<br />
I said, taking out my phone as I entered the parking lot.<br />
I needed to tell him about the bracelet and going into a dungeon with Myeongwoo.  </p>
<p>Guild Leader? Did you ask Kim Sunghan ahjussi or Team Head Suk.<br />
No.<br />
Should I try calling?When I opened my contacts, Yerim stuck out her head and stared.  </p>
<p>What did you name my number.<br />
Yerim.<br />
Ahjussi really seems like an ahjussi.<br />
They’re all just names.<br />
I mean, what now? Of course you wrote in names; what else would you write? Yerim snatched my phone away and and scrolled straight through my contacts.  </p>
<p>Guild Leader is also just ‘younger brother’? That’s unexpected.<br />
Huh? What’s this? Skill? Who is it.<br />
Sung Hyunjae.<br />
…The Seseong Guild Leader.<br />
Yeah.<br />
It’s not even his name – how did it become Skill.<br />
Because he’s just that.<br />
Yerim laughed, going ‘wow, treated as a skill’.<br />
I took my phone back from Yerim, who was asking why it was so empty and was recommending apps, and called Kim Sunghan.<br />
When I asked him about Yoohyun’s location, a surprising answer came back.<br />
The special isolation center?[Yes.<br />
He left about one hour ago.<br />
Why did he go there? Right now, the A-Rank Hunters centered around Yoon Kyeongsoo were locked up at the special isolation center.<br />
MKC’s Choi Sukwon alone had escaped to the detention center, and the remaining were planned to be strictly punished.<br />
Putting aside visiting since it was a matter related to me, why wasn’t he answering me contacting him? Did they block calls there? No, I had sent the text an hour ago.<br />
I had a slight ominous hunch.  </p>
<p>He said Guild Leader is at the special isolation center.<br />
Yeah.<br />
Looks like I should go soon.<br />
It’s foreboding no matter how I look at it.<br />
Should I call Soyoung unni? It should be twice as fast as going by car.<br />
……Um, that was.  </p>
<p>There’s stacks of tickets, but she has never gotten into an accident.<br />
…Alright.<br />
Let’s do that.<br />
Was there a helmet lying around somewhere? *** The fire elemental that was in the shape of a small lizard, quietly circled its owner’s ankle.<br />
Then, it went down before his foot and seeped into the floor.<br />
The movements of the elemental, who left only a little faint dark spot as it passed through the layered walls, weren’t noticed by anyone except for the owner who gave the order.<br />
Faintly smiling as he sat in the waiting room, Han Yoohyun stared at the man who was standing on the other side of the table.<br />
Song Taewon let out a sigh that he couldn’t completely hold back.  </p>
<p>Unless you are one of the victims themselves, it is impossible to visit the special isolation center prisoners.<br />
Even if you are the brother, it is not allowed.<br />
How particular.<br />
I merely have a few things I want to ask.<br />
It is possible if you have the agreement of the prisoner, but Yoon Kyeongsoo, as well as all the other Hunters, refused the visit.<br />
Would there be any cause for them to accept? He had a smile on his face, but it was clearly obvious how Han Yoohyun wanted to handle the prisoners.<br />
Song Taewon spoke to the young man who was difficult in a different way than Sung Hyunjae.<br />
So please go back now.<br />
As I have already come here, I will wait until hyung arrives.<br />
He is supposed to visit today, correct.<br />
…I understand.<br />
He hesitated slightly, but Song Taewon nodded his head.<br />
Once Han Yoojin, who was directly involved in the incident, arrived, it would become hard to block the visit.<br />
But at the same time, Han Yoohyun would be as quiet as was manageable in front of his hyung.<br />
‘It’s enough to be amazed.<br />
’ The one who changed the most noticeably was Han Yoohyun, but it wasn’t just him.<br />
Riette quietly went to the detention center, and Sung Hyunjae treated the fledgling Hunter tolerantly, whatever inner motives he had.<br />
There was no need to speak of Bak Yerim, and it was probably because of the kiseungsu, but apparently he was close to Moon Hyuna, too.<br />
Whatever the reason was, it was a happy phenomenon for Song Taewon.<br />
Since Han Yoojin, who was at the center, was someone with whom you could resolve things through conversation.<br />
The moment he was relaxing.<br />
com Along with the sound of something bursting, Kooreureung- There was the sound of something collapsing and breaking and burning.<br />
The bell of the emergency phone on the wall rang, and Song Taewon couldn’t hide his confusion as he lifted the receiver.<br />
An urgent voice saying that a portion of the imprisonment facility had broken spilled out to even Han Yoohyun’s ears.  </p>
<p>It seems they were tired of being quietly locked up.<br />
Speaking calmly with a tone that was gentle to the point of being warm, Han Yoohyun stood from his seat.<br />
Something red faintly flashed up from his feet, and hid its appearance.<br />
Song Taewon hardened his face and turned to look at the very young Hunter.  </p>
<p>There is no need to pay attention to it.<br />
The imprisonment measures are in place, so it is enough with just the Hunters inside the isolation center.<br />
If you say so.<br />
An explosive sound was heard again.<br />
Han Yoohyun took a long and sleek sword out from his inventory.<br />
One of his eyes held a red light.  </p>
<p>Though if the inventory sealing tool breaks, then even the imprisonment measures would not be useful.<br />
They are S-Rank, A-Rank Hunters, so they would have ample high rank potions and recovery or curse resistance equipment.<br />
com Even if it was the special isolation center’s inhumane imprisonment measures, as long as you could take out and use potions, you could break out.<br />
It was the same for the curse-related restriction.  </p>
<p>…I am curious how you are certain that the sealing tool is broken.<br />
It is that noisy, so is it not an obvious guess? So I will help.<br />
Han Yoohyun walked toward the entrance.<br />
Song Taewon reflexively blocked his path.<br />
If he sent him like this, there wouldn’t be anyone left alive among the Hunters led by Yoon Kyeongsoo.  </p>
<p>There is no need for hel-.<br />
Chief Song.<br />
If you don’t want to see yourself, as well as the other innocent people, get hurt, then go and evacuate them.<br />
Is that a threat.<br />
I am holding back.<br />
Or why don’t you nitpick with Sung Hyunjae? If he had cleanly disposed of them inside the dungeon, there would not have been any need to work this hard.<br />
Did he possibly leave me my share?Song Taewon moved to the side in the end.<br />
Truthfully, they were people that, even if they had been massacred inside the dungeon, it wouldn’t have been weird.<br />
Rather than increasing the damage by blocking Han Yoohyun, it would be better to evacuate people like he said.<br />
com Even after making that decision, Song Taewon’s complexion wasn’t good.<br />
The gaze staring at the young man leisurely walking out of the door, was cold beyond measure.<br />
Beasts free of their reins.<br />
Monsters[2 that didn’t even have leashes to be tied down with.<br />
He himself was also included, so it was even more detestable.<br />
Song Taewon clenched his teeth and moved in order to clean up afterwards.<br />
*** Hunter Kang Soyoung’s competency was impressive.<br />
Not only that, her combination with Yerim was also great.<br />
If we were caught at a signal or was blocked by a road that you had to turn back on, she lifted the bike as well and flew past, so there really were no obstacles.<br />
Even though my insides flipped over a bit, we were able to arrive at the special isolation center in the outskirts in a scarily fast time.  </p>
<p>It looks like Guild Leader already made a mess.<br />
Though it was after one side of the isolation center had collapsed down.<br />
It was a relief in terms of safety, that the surroundings were a field.<br />
But a fire was spreading out.<br />
I saw a fire truck from far away, but it couldn’t approach the place that was on fire.<br />
Since, there would only be innocent victims if they happened to be swept up in a fight between Hunters.  </p>
<p>Yerim, can you put out the fire.<br />
Yes! Soyoung unni, ahjussi-.<br />
No, I’m going to go in, too.<br />
At my words, Yerim’s eyes went round.  </p>
<p>Ahjussi, are you crazy.<br />
Let’s use nice words.<br />
I have the item from that time.<br />
Don’t worry, and I’ll leave putting out the fire to you.<br />
Thank you for driving us here, Soyoung-ssi.<br />
Please stand off to the side, in case you get swept up.<br />
I will receive thanks in the form of Noah-ssi’s contact information, and I will just watch!Kang Soyoung excitedly took out her cell phone.<br />
…Was she filming right now? Besides that, Noah’s contact information – was it that she couldn’t give up? I understood, but please think of Comet.<br />
A barricade was set up, and the isolation center’s Hunters were standing guard, but they didn’t block S-Rank Hunter Yerim.<br />
I was able to go inside as Yerim’s extra as well.<br />
When I used the bracelet, and went inside the building that didn’t have traces of people as if most had evacuated, I saw corpses that were left after being burned.  </p>
<p>Yerim, you go toward the side where the fire is spreading.<br />
It’s not like it’s my first time seeing a corpse.<br />
Hey! Still, there’s nothing good about looking at them!It was impossible to not see them at all, but it would be good if she saw less of them at least.<br />
Even at my nagging, Yerim floated around the surroundings, pretending to not have heard, and put out the embers with Sigh.<br />
In the meantime, one more corpse appeared.<br />
This time, I remembered the face.<br />
It was one of the Hunters who had attacked in the dungeon last time.<br />
‘…Yoohyun, this punk.<br />
’ He had acted like he would reasonably let it go.<br />
Avoiding the building wreckage, I walked more inwards, when someone jumped down in front of me.  </p>
<p>Why did you come this early?Yoohyun looked down at me with a smiling face.  </p>
<p>What ‘early’! Did you kill them all? What about Yoon Kyeongsoo.<br />
Wouldn’t he have died by now? Don’t mind it.<br />
It was weird that the Seseong Guild Leader let it go, and they even tried to escape, so it’s the obvious result.<br />
com I also was surprised at Sung Hyunjae’s intention to reuse them, but to think that it was escape.<br />
When I sent a skeptical gaze, that little brother smiled shamelessly.  </p>
<p>Let’s just go.<br />
What time is it? Should we eat lunch?”Advertisements.<br />
He is alive, though.<br />
What? At Yerim’s words out of the blue, Yoohyun and I turned our heads at the same time.<br />
Yoon Kyeongsoo was standing in the place Yerim was staring at.<br />
With his neck about half sliced.  </p>
<p>No, is he dead? But he is moving.<br />
What is it?Yerim tilted her head, and Yoohyun frowned.<br />
And then Yoon Kyeongsoo opened his mouth.  </p>
<p>Hi!It was an unfamiliar woman’s voice.<br />
[1 it just means ‘completely boss arnd’, sort of like eng ‘under sb’s thumb’, but I thought the lit.<br />
meaning was understandable so I left as is [2 krn word for monster, which I’ve been tl-ing as ‘fiend’ to differentiate, since the eng word transliterated is what is used for the monsters that come out from dungeons.<br />
But word-choice-wise, I think ‘monster’ is the best to use here.  </p>

    <h1 id="the-s-classes-that-i-raised-2">The S-Classes That I Raised-2.</h1>
<p>I pulled out a dagger and made a long cut on my forearm.<br />
Blood leaked out of the cut and formed a dark red spear.<br />
Dazzling black flames flowed from the tip of the spear and wound around the shaft.<br />
-Grrrr Lauchitas, who had previously looked down on my and ignored me, raised all three of its heads at the same time.<br />
Its hackles rose, wary at the sight of the spear that had taken its eyes.<br />
Its mouth opened, showing the rows of serrated teeth that lay within.<br />
If it were the original me, I would have long collapsed under its pressure before I could even meet its eyes.<br />
But now I couldn’t even feel the slightest bit of tension.<br />
I was sure.<br />
It was weaker than me.  </p>
<p>C’mon, you fucking lizard.<br />
’ -Grrrr! It cried as if in answer.<br />
The entire area was shaken by the roar that was full of life.<br />
The three heads of the red giant completely rose off the ground.<br />
There were no wings.<br />
Instead it had a sleek body that wore awful curses all over it, like a leopard’s spotted coat.<br />
Its long tail were full of speckled and patterned swirls, along with a set of thorns.<br />
Thud! Its four feet hit the ground.<br />
The sickle-like claws, which resembled the scythes of the god of death, left long scars on the floor.<br />
It had unimaginably fast movement for such a giant body.<br />
In one move, the creature crossed the space between us in a single leap.<br />
If it had been the me from before, I wouldn’t have been able to catch it.<br />
com But now I could.  </p>
<p>Why aren’t you crawling?I felt like it was a puppy that was running around.<br />
My brother was ranked 3 in terms of speed among the world’s strongest adults and teenagers.<br />
If my younger brother had been alone, the attacks of this little three-headed lizard wouldn’t be allowed to even graze him.<br />
At this moment, I was faster than him.<br />
Tap! I jumped into the air with a twisted mockery of a smile.<br />
Smash! The creature’s claws broke through the ground I had been standing on.<br />
As I lazily looked down at the scene, I used a flood of skills.  </p>
<p>Blue Willow Leaves.<br />
Leaves that could only be seen by the caster scattered over the area.<br />
I stepped on the leaves with my toes and jumped up into the air once again.<br />
com The highly poisonous Lauchitas jumped up again and again but I nimbly dodged its claws.<br />
Its curses, that shot up at me like stingers, was blocked by the shield.<br />
Graaa! The baby lizard on the ground roared.<br />
If you don’t like this, come up here with your wings! My brother had no flying skills.<br />
But with the Blue Willow Leaves skill, he could dance in the air as if we were on the ground.<br />
There wasn’t any goddamn thing that he couldn’t do.  </p>
<p>No, he couldn’t cut ties with a useless older brother.<br />
Muttering, I pulled the spear in my head to the side.<br />
I wound the black flames back and pulled as if I were pulling a bow.<br />
Shoot! -Grrrr! The spear that I fired penetrated the left head of Lauchitas.<br />
The black flames soared and the pierced head melted away in an instant.<br />
The lizard went mad with pain, running wild, swinging its claws and biting with its teeth.<br />
However, it was too slow.<br />
com Thud! Thud! Like an eel that had been dragged ashore onto dry land, it jumped up and down on its bottom.<br />
It was a funny scene.<br />
That bastard’s funny, but I’m funny too.<br />
I used my blood to create a new spear.<br />
Bam! -Kuh! Graa! The right head was also smashed.<br />
With the loss of the heads that had working eyes, the Lauchitas was discern the world around it.<br />
The creature with scales all over its body stopped moving around and crouched down.<br />
It was as if it was scared.  </p>
<p>……this is too easy.<br />
It was so easy that I was almost in tears.<br />
It met its end too quickly.<br />
If I burned the last head, even the most powerful dragon species wouldn’t be able to withstand it, but I aimed for the legs instead of the head.<br />
It was as helpless as a fish drying up on hot sand as I cut its limbs off one by one.<br />
com for the best novel reading experience Slowly, gently.<br />
The monster shrieked, groaned, and then took its final, dying gasps.<br />
The floor was like a bloody version of a muddy swamp, but the Lauchitas was still alive.<br />
I clicked my tongue and sat on its body.<br />
Time was almost up.<br />
Once the timer for the skill was over, I would immediately die from the venom of Lauchitas’ carcass.<br />
What a useless person, I was.  </p>
<p>What else could I do even if I survived?If people knew that Yuhyun was dead because of me, his older brother, I would probably be sentenced to a public execution.<br />
If I was tied to the square, people would come from all over the world to stone me.  </p>
<p>I would go down in history, maybe even in textbooks.<br />
I have been cursed a lot so far, but now I’m sure I’m going to be cursed for generations to come.<br />
Haha.<br />
Why did you die instead of me, my stupid younger brother? It was really useless.<br />
Ah, fuck.<br />
I should have died back then when I had broken my leg.<br />
Then I wouldn’t be as horrible as I am now and Yuhyun wouldn’t have died for me.<br />
He really saved such a useless and unnecessary guy.<br />
com I thumped on the scales of the Lauchitas, which was breathing its last breaths, with the palm of my hand.  </p>
<p>I’m not going to live much longer so don’t be unfair.<br />
Why did you come out of a D Class Dungeon anyway? Did the managers miscalculate the Class?Either way, it didn’t matter to me anymore.<br />
There was no way I had the energy to leave before the effects of my skill ended.  </p>
<p>Why hadn’t I simply supported Yuhyun from behind and lived well?Getting protected by my good-natured younger brother and just live off of him; why did I get this inferiority complex? Just then, the reward window for the death of Lauchitas popped up.<br />
[Impossible Achievement! You have hunted a dragon alone! Yuhyun had shot the dragon too; why was it considered alone? Maybe it was because of the time difference between his attacks and mine.<br />
com for a better experience Dragon Slayer.<br />
It sounded like a title with some great stats, but I hadn’t checked it.<br />
How did I know? A pumpkin is still a pumpkin even if you draw lines on it.<br />
Then, my level rose and a series of items appeared one after another.<br />
[Gatestone x10 [Grade 1 Grant Amount x5 [Red Dragon’s Great Sword [Wish Stone Huh? Wish Stone? While glancing through the items in the window, the first thing I noticed was the Wish Stone.<br />
It was my first time seeing such an item.  </p>
<p>Just by seeing your name, it seems like you’ll be able to grant me a wish.<br />
com No way.<br />
Something like that could only be a scam.<br />
Though I thought it was ridiculous, I still sat up.<br />
When I opened the inventory, I saw a red bead that was just a little smaller than my fist.<br />
Swallowing dryly, I took the beads out and checked the information on it.<br />
[Wish Stone – Myth Class Grants one wish for the user.<br />
It’s real!.<br />
Then, my younger brother-![※ Resurrection of the deceased is not allowed.  </p>
<p>com I belatedly noticed the last condition of the item.<br />
Why wasn’t I able to save a dead person? A Myth Class should be a Myth Class! If you are a god, you should be able to do whatever you want!.<br />
Dammit, then what’s the point?! Everything except saving people? I, I just…!I grasped the Wish Stone tightly in my hand.<br />
Things that I could wish for instantly flashed through my head.<br />
If it could grant any wish, I might be able to become stronger than Yuhyun.<br />
Maybe I could keep my current state.<br />
Then I could get rid of my bad reputation.<br />
People would soon forget the heroes of the past and praise the new ones.<br />
I could finally take the position that I had been so envious of.<br />
In a much more glorious position, I could climb higher than anyone.<br />
I was caught in delusion and rolled my eyes, and sighed for a long time.  </p>
<p>……Yuhyun, you.<br />
You’re really screwing with me until the end.<br />
com I might regret it.<br />
No, I’m sure that I would regret it.<br />
So, I won’t regret anything.<br />
I’m already coated with layers of regret, if I added one more, would it make a difference?.<br />
Hey, Wish Stone.<br />
Is it possible to turn back time?As if in answer, the red bead began to shine.<br />
The dead could not be raised, but I could still do this.<br />
It seemed like it was better to turn the clock back, how funny.<br />
Then to before I came in here, no.<br />
Just bring me back to five years ago.<br />
With my current memory.<br />
I’ll live quietly and live well this time around.<br />
If I hadn’t gone out, I wouldn’t have been in trouble and my legs would be fine.<br />
Yuhyun wouldn’t be upset because of me.<br />
Everything would be fine.<br />
I would just live off of my brother’s surplus money.<br />
com for the best novel reading experience.<br />
Yeah.<br />
The light shining from the beads grew stronger.<br />
All my eyes saw was bright red burn, and then suddenly everything became white.<br />
And.<br />
The sight of a strange room settled in front of my restored vision.  </p>

<p>&lt; A Date First of All (1) .  </p>
<p>Uh…… um.<br />
Maybe he had cried the entire time because the rims of his eyes were red.<br />
With his complexion being pale and him looking like he had no strength, he seemed like a paper doll that had fallen into water and was carelessly fished out and dried.<br />
This guy looked more severe than me, who was kidnapped.  </p>
<p>…Are you okay?Though normally, I should be the one being asked if I was okay.<br />
As soon as I spoke, huge droplets[1 of tears started to drop from Myeongwoo.<br />
Now, was pulling me over into his embrace next? Well, it seemed like he worried a lot, so I should calmly receive it.<br />
And there was a lot of free food I had gotten from him too.<br />
But, Yoo Myeongwoo just cried without a sound and didn’t come towards me.<br />
Why was he like this? Was the shock too big? Did that guy, instead of me, need to be sent to the hospital?.<br />
……I’m okay, though.<br />
I’m fine.<br />
I’m not even hurt anywhere.<br />
I don’t know what to do, so just say something.<br />
Should I put Peace down and pull him over into my embrace first? I was the victim, though.<br />
……There was nothing I could do.<br />
Finally, Myeongwoo opened his mouth.  </p>
<p>I, really… nothing at all……The voice that was forcefully squeezed out was stained with guilt.<br />
It wasn’t that I didn’t understand.<br />
The person who had saved him several times already, had met with danger, but he had to stay cooped up in a room corner.<br />
But.  </p>
<p>But that’s not your fault.<br />
You must have been unable to move and was confined somewhere.<br />
Yoo Myeongwoo wasn’t a normal employee, much less a guild member.<br />
He was still employed by me.<br />
So, if a sensitive problem occurred within the guild like this matter, naturally his actions could only have been restricted.<br />
Or rather, it would be a relief if it had ended with house arrest.<br />
There was the possibility of receiving suspicion and being investigated.<br />
You’re in the position of being an outsider to a certain point, so the problem might’ve gotten bigger if you had tried to put yourself forward.<br />
So don’t worry.<br />
But I……He swallowed his words and chewed on his lips, before wiping away his tears.<br />
That guy raised the head that was lowered, and smiled.  </p>
<p>Sorry.<br />
You should be tired but I acted all annoying.<br />
Hurry and come in.<br />
No, it’s okay…Your reaction was more worrying.<br />
What was it? I would have let it pass with ‘he’s the same as ever’ if he had clung to me and bawled.<br />
The atmosphere like he had organized things and made a decision and resolved his heart all by himself, was uncomfortable.  </p>
<p>It’s really okay.<br />
In the first place, it’s a problem that the guilds that contracted to protect me should figure out.<br />
I said again, taking off my shoes and coming in.<br />
Myeongwoo halfheartedly nodded and asked if I wanted to eat something light.<br />
I was thinking of sleeping early, but I hadn’t eaten lunch or dinner, so it would be good to fill my stomach up at little.<br />
And I had to feed Peace dinner too.<br />
com Peace, who had jumped onto the bed, turned around in circles.<br />
It seemed like he was feeling better after eating.  </p>
<p>You shouldn’t go up without even washing your paws.<br />
Come here.<br />
I picked up Peace and went to the bathroom attached the bedroom.<br />
When I did, he whined and pretended to be pitiful.  </p>
<p>Since you went outside, you have to wash.<br />
Inside the cage wasn’t clean either.<br />
-Kkooeuoong.<br />
Okay, okay.<br />
Let’s just take a simple shower.<br />
Maybe because he was part of the cat family and was flame attribute, he really didn’t like washing.<br />
After coaxing him and showering together, and washing and even drying his fur, I became tired even with the higher stats.<br />
The psychological reason was probably bigger than the physical, but I wondered if I would die from overwork from looking after five when my stats return to normal.  </p>
<p>Let’s sleep now.<br />
When I turned off the lights and closed my eyes, I opened them again only a bit later.<br />
In the middle of the dark, I saw Peace hunched over and stuck right next to me.<br />
The red fur along with the mixed in golden hairs were more clearly visible than normal.<br />
So my vision had gotten slightly better too.<br />
com for the best novel reading experience I looked at him for a bit, and then took out a glass bottle from my inventory.<br />
The red stone inside the bottle emitted a faint light.<br />
‘Still, all of them are S-Ranks and planned to be S-Ranks.<br />
’ Yoo Myeongwoo was stat F-Rank, but he wouldn’t need to attack dungeons, so he would be safe.<br />
If he just got the skill, he would get protected almost as much as I was.<br />
I didn’t have to worry too much about the remaining four.<br />
Of all the S-Rank Hunters in the world, even 5 years later when the level of difficulty rose, there weren’t any who had died in an attack, except for exactly one.<br />
…If you considered Yoohyun as well, then it was two.<br />
Anyways, it meant that if they didn’t do anything in particular, they wouldn’t die.<br />
The death rate for A-Rank Hunters was also extremely low.<br />
Low rank Hunters, well, there were many and many died, and for mid rank Hunters, surprisingly, B-Ranks had a higher death rate than C-Ranks.<br />
It was because unlike C-Ranks, B-Ranks also went into high rank dungeon attacks.<br />
‘For my mental health at least, it should be better to only apply the keyword to possible S-Ranks, at minimum A-Ranks.<br />
’ High rank familiars would be well taken care of, as much as they were valuable.<br />
If it really didn’t work out, I should turn off the poison resistance and borrow the strength of modern medical science.<br />
Before the regression, when I was just constantly drinking, suddenly people appeared and dragged me to a hospital and I got treated for alcoholism, but they did it really well.<br />
com At that time, I wasn’t normal so I didn’t think much, but it really was weird that people unlocked the main entrance and came in, just because I had fallen into alcohol for about a week.<br />
The quality of the facility and counselling was really good too.<br />
The counselor had told me that if it got tough, to contact them anytime, and even gave me their business card.<br />
I wondered if that person was working even now.<br />
Anyways, if it was possible, it would be great if the Last Repayment skill had no reason to be invoked again.<br />
And it was all too much of a waste to end just with 7 days.<br />
I put the glass bottle into my inventory and closed my eyes again.<br />
The next day, I spent all of it inside my house.<br />
Peace didn’t really want to go outside too, and Myeongwoo also didn’t go to sharpen knives, and made snacks for me.<br />
I didn’t know he also had a talent for baking.<br />
I had a hard time stopping myself from automatically saying I wanted us to live together forever.<br />
In the afternoon, Yoohyun visited with a key technician.<br />
Saying that they had thoroughly searched the entire building, but couldn’t find the inventory sealing bracelet.<br />
That was because I had it.<br />
I should’ve put it somewhere, but I had forgotten, and had come back just bringing it over.  </p>
<p>And Hunter Bak Yerim was caught in a stats drop curse for contract violation.<br />
I was touching the wrist that had the bracelet, when Yoohyun said something confusing.  </p>
<p>com Uh… then again, it was a contract that had entrusted my guarding to her, so it would be called a violation.<br />
Hearing about it, the time when the curse appeared wasn’t right after the kidnapping, but a little bit after.<br />
I thought it might have been when I was being beaten up.<br />
Since I put in a vague condition like ‘guard’, it seemed like it based it on violence above a certain amount being applied to the guarding target.<br />
Since, when I was kidnapped, besides being grabbed, there wasn’t much else.<br />
And passing out was because of using up mana.  </p>
<p>For the Association, hyung can just contact them to say it wasn’t a contract violation, and for the curse, the related curse skill holder can lift it.<br />
The problem is that Hunter Bak Yerim is refusing it.<br />
Huh, why.<br />
She said it was true that she couldn’t uphold the contract and that she would pay the cost.<br />
Yerim, that guy[2, really, being stubborn over something pointless.  </p>
<p>I’ll talk to her about it.<br />
I’ll leave it to you.<br />
Since she listens well to hyung.<br />
com She didn’t listen well to that extent.  </p>
<p>Ah, wait.<br />
I grabbed Yoohyun, who had finished his business and was about to leave.<br />
That guy turned to look at me.  </p>
<p>So, gate stones.<br />
Do you happen to have any left?They were precious even 5 years later, so asking for one when they were even more precious now, made my face hot.<br />
But I really needed one.<br />
Right now, my state was close to an A-Rank combat Hunter.<br />
In other words, I could attack a low rank dungeon by myself.<br />
Of course, my real goal wasn’t the dungeon attack, but the contact from the person who made the system.<br />
If I used the most out Lizard Stuck on the Wall, it wouldn’t be hard to secretly go outside.<br />
If I bought an F-Rank dungeon exclusive entrance pass, the secret would be guaranteed too.<br />
But, it was a problem because something like a system error could happen and a monster outside of the rank could appear again.<br />
com ‘I could interact with the person who made the system in front of the dungeon entrance, and use Wall Lizard and come out straight away, in such a case, but I can’t know if contact will come before the entrance closes.<br />
’ I wanted to take one gate stone to prepare for possible danger.<br />
If I really couldn’t, I could wait during the time before the entrance closes and just leave if there is no contact, but then it would be a waste of money and the chance.<br />
The application of Last Repayment also had just 6 days left now.  </p>
<p>Why? It wouldn’t be to go into a dungeon?That little brother frowned right away.  </p>
<p>Well, I can’t just not go in at all.<br />
I want to go in my spare time and go up at least 30 levels.<br />
I might just get something like a defense skill.<br />
Of course, I didn’t have anything like that.<br />
What exactly was my aptitude? Did I not have something like an aptitude because I was just a normal and easy ordinary person A?.<br />
But there’s this matter too, and also that bird appearing last time.<br />
No matter what, it’s uneasy.<br />
Of course, I know it’s precious, but……Ah crap, the more I talked, the more it felt pathetic.<br />
Should I just buy a few exclusive bids, and go in and out of them a lot? Was there a penalty if you bought exclusive bids and came out without doing an attack? I had never wasted money like that, or even thought of doing so, so I couldn’t remember.  </p>
<p>…Specifically getting up to 30 levels isn’t bad.<br />
The 10 level skill was S-Rank and among the initial skills, one was A-Rank, so the probability of a skill with a high rank coming out is high.<br />
com Yoohyun wasn’t inclined to it, but nodded his head.  </p>
<p>Instead, I’ll choose the dungeon to attack and the team you’ll do it with.<br />
That’s okay, right.<br />
I have to get your help anyways; I can’t attack even an F-Rank by myself.<br />
When I chattered on, Yoohyun took out a gate stone.<br />
My conscience was pricked.<br />
Still, you couldn’t do something stupid when you were a stat F-Rank.  </p>
<p>You have reserves, right?If it was just this one, then it would be better to not take it.  </p>
<p>I do.<br />
In the first place, it’s something that doesn’t need to be used.<br />
Since me using a gate stone would be the same as meaning I’ve lost most of the main attack team.<br />
It would be better than me dying as well, but the guild would probably look miserable?He was saying something brutal while smiling.<br />
Like that guy said, it was something that was a hundred times better not to use.<br />
I nodded my head to agree and put the gate stone in my inventory.<br />
I should look for F-Rank dungeons where exclusive bids were possible and that were located as close as possible.<br />
Peace, we should go out today.<br />
Hm?If it was normal, he would have whined about going out first, but Peace didn’t seem inclined at all to go out today as well.<br />
He wouldn’t have known the situation too well because he was asleep, but the aftereffects were excessive.<br />
I thought it wouldn’t be good to leave him like this, so I purposefully held him and went out.<br />
It would be good if we could go outdoors instead of to the basement training room.<br />
I went toward the elevator while coaxing Peace, who was fluttering his tail in dissatisfaction.<br />
Today, the person who would be entrusted with my guard was.<br />
‘Huh? That face is…’ It was a face I remembered.<br />
A beautiful fairy-like woman with gorgeous blond hair and deep blue eyes that were close to navy.<br />
She came towards me and smiled brightly.  </p>
<p>Hello! I am Seseong’s Kang Soyoung!Seseong’s A-Rank Hunter Kang Soyoung.<br />
She wasn’t of Korean descent, but was a British person who was recruited by the Seseong Guild Leader and also had Korean citizenship.<br />
Limited to B-Rank and higher Hunters, even dual citizenship was permitted without conditions.<br />
com ‘She was in a scandal with Yoohyun.<br />
’ It wasn’t decided that they were dating, but quite a lot of rumors circulated.<br />
That young lady could possibly become my sister-in-law[3.<br />
Seeing her for real, she was even prettier.<br />
There was still a little hint of youth, so she was cute as well.<br />
Her expression was bright and lovable.  </p>
<p>Hello, I am Han Yoojin.<br />
Please take care of me for today.<br />
I would like to request that of you!Yeah, cute.<br />
Her personality seemed good too.<br />
Hearing the cheerful voice, I automatically smiled.  </p>
<p>So this child must be Peace.<br />
He is even cuter than when I saw him on TV!Kang Soyoung said in a bouncy tone.<br />
Our Peace was indeed cute.<br />
As expected, she was a great young lady.  </p>
<p>com for the best novel reading experience.<br />
Yes.<br />
Pressing the elevator button, she tossed a look with a sparkling light in her eyes.<br />
It was a little embarrassing because it was an expression like she was a fan seeing a celebrity.  </p>
<p>I was really alarmed when I heard the news.<br />
It is really a relief that you are safe.<br />
Thank you for worrying.<br />
I was being sincere.<br />
Really.<br />
Han Yoojin-nim is my only hope.<br />
Hope?What hope? Kang Soyoung boarded the elevator and energetically nodded her head.  </p>
<p>Actually, I have one SS-Rank skill.<br />
She said softly, lowering her volume.<br />
An SS-Rank skill? I hadn’t heard that Kang Soyoung had such a thing.<br />
I wanted to try using the Seed-Leaf skill, but right now, her gaze was piercing into me, so I couldn’t.<br />
Let’s try it later secretly.<br />
If it is alright, could I hear what kind of skill it is.<br />
That is right… Han Yoojin-nim would come to know it anyways.<br />
”Advertisements Kang Soyoung’s voice became more and more soft.<br />
Continuing, I heard a whisper.  </p>
<p>It is Dragon Rider.<br />
Ah… It was worth me being her hope.<br />
Really.<br />
The monsters that were the most difficult to tame were exactly dragon types.<br />
On top of that, Kang Soyoung was an A-Rank Hunter, so finding a dragon type familiar that matched her rank would be like plucking a star from the sky.<br />
Since it was hard starting from finding a dragon type familiar, they couldn’t be used as expendables, and she would’ve had to consider it as just not having the SS-Rank skill.  </p>
<p>You must have gone through many hardships.<br />
Kang Soyoung nodded with an eager expression.  </p>
<p>Yes.<br />
I cannot explain the specifics, but it is a really, really good skill.<br />
But only if I have a dragon type familiar that matches my rank.<br />
com She stopped speaking and even tears glimmered in her eyes.<br />
That a combat Hunter couldn’t use an SS-Rank skill, how frustrating would that have been?.<br />
Still, if it is a dragon type, it would be hard to find them as a baby monster.<br />
Even if I could raise familiars, you couldn’t make something out of nothing.<br />
There needed to be a baby of a high rank monster, to raise it.  </p>
<p>Please do not worry! There is a place among the S-Rank dungeons under Seseong’s jurisdiction, where a dragon’s nest appears sometimes.<br />
Though, they only appear as eggs, and it being impossible to make them hatch is a problem, but this time, I decided to firmly prepare and wait until it naturally hatches.<br />
……You must have many hardships ahead.<br />
Still, if I do well, I could get a highest rank baby monster.<br />
It is worth suffering for.<br />
Then again, it was as good as dragon type.<br />
If she could only just get it, it would become the best familiar.<br />
In addition, if it was combined with Kang Soyoung’s apparently impressive SS-Rank skill… she would only be called an A-Rank, but outshine S-Ranks.<br />
Ah, I wanted to introduce my brother.<br />
They should already know each other’s faces at least.<br />
Couldn’t they meet a little faster than before the regression? Even if they didn’t formally date, they should’ve had goodwill for each other at least, for the scandal to break out.<br />
Advertisements We arrived at the training room in an amicable atmosphere.<br />
But Peace didn’t even think about coming down from my arms.<br />
When I loosened my arms, he crawled up to my shoulders and stuck close.<br />
This….<br />
It seems like Peace’s shock over being kidnapped was big…Kang Soyoung said, with an expression filled with worry.  </p>
<p>He was sleeping the whole time, but it seems like he felt something.<br />
It would be good if I could refresh his mood, but we cannot go outside.<br />
Ah, then what do you think of going over to our guild building? We have a roof garden.<br />
It is large and well decorated.<br />
A roof garden?It was alluring, but the problem was that Yoohyun probably wouldn’t let us go out.  </p>
<p>It is regretful, but with the kidnapping matter, it seems it will be hard to go out right now.<br />
At my words, Kang Soyoung thrust her chest out confidently.  </p>
<p>Please do not worry.<br />
I will supplement with more people to perfectly guard you.<br />
And right now, Guild Leader is at the guild.<br />
It is safer than anywhere!Um, suddenly, I didn’t want to go.<br />

<h1 id="vocanic-age-chapter-20">Vocanic Age Chapter 20</h1>
<p>Editor: Imagine
After a few days the group was able to arrive at Kaiyang.</p>
<p>Kaiyang was a sizable village.
 Guizhou was a place that was separated in north and south.
 The north was the territory of the Righteous Faction and the South was the territory of the Death Faction.
 Guiyang was a village that was near that place.
 It was located at the front lines and that was why this place had the most martial artists of the Righteous Faction in it.</p>
<p>Oh my, looking at your faces that are fit to be king, you may be great figures of the Righteous Faction.
 This petty merchant saw these great figures walk in a dignified way from a distance and couldnt keep my excitement.
 When they entered Guiyang they were able to see several barkers.
 And among them, the one calling himself a petty merchant approached them first.</p>
<p>What is it? Jang Hong looked at the merchant as if it was dumbfounding.</p>
<p>Excessive compliment was seen as flattery.
 The words of the merchant had already passed the level of being a compliment.</p>
<p>Haha.
 Gu Pung looked at the merchant as if it was fun and laughed out loud.
 He then took out a coin from his bosom and then flicked it towards the merchant.</p>
<p>We dont need to unpack the luggage at the inn, so stop with the useless guiding and lead us to the Murims Association here in Guiyang.
 If you think of pulling anything funny I wont let it pass easily, so keep that in mind.
 Of course great master!
The merchant snatched the coin in the air and bowed down.
 He had bowed so low that his head was about to touch the ground.</p>
<p>And then, the other barkers that were nearby clicked their tongues and fell back.
 It seemed like they were regretting having missed a customer.</p>
<p>Only then did Jang Hong realize what was going on and nodded with his head.</p>
<p>If you arrive at another province there will be full of barkers like them.
 So you just have to give them a few coins and tell them to lead you to where you want.
 Gu Pung walked slowly and explained kindly.</p>
<p>Also, if your destination is a province in the Murim Association there is no need for you to go to an inn.
 They will get you a lodging except for special occasions.
 Even though this information was small, it was still enough to be of help in a trip to Kang Ho.</p>
<p>If it wasnt something Ju Seo Cheon knew, he would have listened attentively and engraved it into his head.</p>
<p>Huk, to say that they will provide lodging in the provinces! The merchant dropped his mouth and got surprised.</p>
<p>All the provinces of the Murim Association werent small at all.
 Every place was capable of easily accommodating a hundred people.</p>
<p>But it didnt mean that it was possible for anyone.
 You would need to have some matters to attend to and also receive permission beforehand.</p>
<p>In other words, it meant that third or second rate martial artists or even non affiliated martial artists were chased out of these places.</p>
<p>Being able to receive lodging in the provinces meant that they werent third rate.</p>
<p>But there was no need to exaggerate like this.
 It seemed like the reaction of the merchant was flattery itself, the exaggeration behind his actions were too excessive.</p>
<p>If its not rude, may I be able to hear your name?
The merchant wore a steel plate in his face and cringed.</p>
<p>His actions were so bold anyone could realize his intent.</p>
<p>I am Gu Pung of Mount Hua.
 Huk! The Fourteenth Gallant Sword! You didnt seem to be normal even since I saw you from before, but you were a disciple of the great Mount Hua! The merchant opened his eyes widely and raised his voice.</p>
<p>‘A great figure!
The Fourteenth Gallant Sword was a well known expert even in Murim.
 He did seem to be like an expert because he was escorting these kids but he didnt know he was such a great figure.</p>
<p>Connections for a merchant were especially important and there was nothing more to speak about if that connection was one of the great figures.</p>
<p>The merchant waved his invisible tail and poured out compliments to Gu Pung.</p>
<p>Be quiet.</p>
<p>Jang Hong wasnt able to endure it and said a word.
 His eyes were showing clear scorn.</p>
<p>Do you have no pride? Jang Hong looked at the merchant as if it was pathetic.</p>
<p>And then, the merchant let out a soft laughter as if he was feeling sorry.
 It seemed like he wasnt that unaware of his surroundings that he stopped speaking.</p>
<p>Jang Hong, whats with that way of speaking.
 You should be careful with your words if you belong to the Righteous Faction.
 Its not that I dont understand how you feel but speak softly.
 Gu Pung rebuked Jang Hong.</p>
<p>Im sorry senior uncle.</p>
<p>Gu Pung didnt scold Jang Hong anymore as he bowed down.
 Even if that was the case he was also starting to feel uncomfortable with the merchant.</p>
<p>Oh my, it seems like I ruined the atmosphere.
 I will make up for it later.
 Here, come over here.
 We will arrive at the branch office in a while.
 Jang Seo Eun was about to say something but she stopped.</p>
<p>Their relationship would end after they arrived at the branch office anyways.</p>
<p>Over here.
 If you need me to lead you somewhere Ill be near….</p>
<p>This is enough.
 Thank you/ Gu Pung smiled bitterly and cut off his words.</p>
<p>He had taken a roundabout way to tell him not to bother him.</p>
<p>Oh my, there has no one been anyone this kind to this barker.
 Anyways, I will certainly pay you back so just call me! Hehehe!
The merchant laughed in a treacherous way and left.</p>
<p>They arrived at the branch office and wrote their names in the visitors book.
 When the one in charge of the register saw the names, they led them kindly to their rooms.</p>
<p>Tch, and he told me to keep waiting.
 One visitor that had been waiting nearby mumbled.</p>
<p>Oho, this person.
 You should be careful of your words.
 It seems like he is an expert of Mount Hua.
 Hup, Mount Hua Sect? Oh my, I almost made a big mistake.
 Thank you.</p>
<p>The visitor lowered his head and hid his face in case someone recognized him.</p>
<p>I doubt he knew we heard him as we seem like ordinary children, right? Jang Seo Eun mumbled with a strange expression.</p>
<p>What does senior brother think? About what? Ju Seo Cheon replied as she called out to him.</p>
<p>The treatment of the one in charge of the register.
 Ju Seo Cheon shut his mouth at her words for a moment and then answered honestly.</p>
<p>Life is not equal in the first place.
 Treatment changes just with your birth.
 No, it may also change depending on your abilities.
 Isnt that reality.</p>
<p>Ju Seo Cheon had received unfair treatment in his past life.
 No, it was the same even after he returned in time.</p>
<p>In his past life he received great treatment because of his background as someone part of the Mount Hua Sect but at times he did receive discrimination because he was a really plain martial artist.</p>
<p>Right now, he was being discriminated against and being laughed at with his nickname.</p>
<p>You can see discrimination everywhere.
 You can already see that with the Lotus Peak in Mount Hua and… Ju Seo Cheon was about to continue speaking but stopped.
 It was because of his surroundings.
 He had spoken out loud too much.</p>
<p>Those words didnt belong to a twelve year old kid at all.
 Ju Seo Cheon rolled his eyes and sweated.</p>
<p>Haha, you are called the flashy but frail one and yet your head is certainly flashy.
 It seems like you have heard those words from somewhere!
Jang Hong didnt think about Ju Seo Cheons words too deeply.</p>
<p>For him, Ju Seo Cheon was the flashy and frail one.
 He was an incompetent being that managed to enter the Lotus Peak with a certain coincidence and luck.</p>
<p>Jang Seo Eun just looked at him in a marvelous way, it seemed like she wasnt thinking too deeply about it.</p>
<p>Hm.
 But it was different for Gu Pung.
 He was looking at Ju Seo Cheon as if it was really interesting and fell in thought.</p>
<p>‘He also proved it in Yangtze River.
 The wisdom of this kid Ju Seo Cheon is more outstanding than other kids.
 If his quality was also good he could have aimed to become a Plum Blossom Sword Examiner, its a real regret.</p>
<p>But that was only increasing the evaluation on him.
 He didnt see Ju Seo Cheon as being particularly great.</p>
<p>Whew, lets be careful.</p>
<p>Ju Seo Cheon let out a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>Maybe it was because of the unfair treatment he received in his past life of not being able to speak what he wanted to but now, his thoughts came out in words right away.</p>
<p>Of course, he was planning to live that way from now on but there were still times that he had to hold back.</p>
<p>I am called Shin Do Gyun, the branch manager of Guiyang.
 Its an honor being able to meet the Fourteenth Gallant Sword.
 Shin Do Gyun showed his white teeth and greeted him.</p>
<p>It is an honor for me for being able to meet the branch manager that is at the front lines of Guizhou.
 Gu Pung replied at Shin Do Gyuns greet with a smiling face.</p>
<p>Shin Do Gyun smiled as someone at the level of the Fourteenth Gallant Sword paid him a compliment.</p>
<p>I have already prepared a room and dinner for you so you will be escorted to it when you get out of this room.
 Im thankful towards you, branch manager of Guiyang, for your great consideration.
 I just did what I had to.
 Moreover, are those young ones members of the Lotus Peak? Is that correct? The three people nodded.</p>
<p>The Lotus Peak of Mount Hua was known in Murim as much as the War Dragons Hall of the Shamans Faction and boasted of its long history.
 Because of that, it became the talk of the down when disciples came out to Kang Ho with a guardian before they became adults.</p>
<p>Kids that werent even twenty years old and belonged to the Mount Hua sect.
 On top of that they had a pinnacle expert guarding them so the answer was obvious.</p>
<p>For me to be able to see the future experts that will shoulder the fate of Mount Hua one day, it isnt so bad to be a branch manager of a province at all.
 Moreover, this wasnt the first time members of the Lotus Peak visited Guiyang.
 Countless members had already visited this place.</p>
<p>Guizhou being in the front lines meant that even though there were many enemies, there were also many experts of the Murim Association in it.</p>
<p>That also meant that they would be able to accumulate experience while being protected by an expert.</p>
<p>Besides the Lotus Peak, a place where geniuses gathered, low leveled institutions also visited this place with the purpose of accumulating experience and merits.</p>
<p>In the case of the guardian of the Lotus Peak, they changed every year so it was the first time the branch manager met with Gu Pung.</p>
<p>The visit of the martial artists from the Lotus Peak was something Shim Do Gyun received annually.</p>
<p>No matter what mission you request us to do, we will fulfill it in the name of Mount Hua.</p>
<p>And the tasks to get real experience were tasked down to the branch manager.</p>
<p>He was one of the people that knew the situation around this place better than anyone.
 Hahaha, your chivalrous spirit is different indeed.
 As expected of the Fourteenth Gallant Sword.
 I will give you your mission soon.</p>
<p>Shin Do Gyun smiled softly.</p>
<p>Ah, in addition the Zhuge Sega is here in the province of Guiyang.
 You will probably be tasked with him in the same mission so it wont be bad to work on your teamwork beforehand.</p>
<p>Gu Pung nodded as if he had expected it.</p>
<p>Guizhou was a place to accumulate experience or merits.
 There were many other martial artists of the Righteous Faction besides Mount Hua sect.</p>
<p>Most of them visit this place once in a year but it was an exception for some forces.</p>
<p>And one of them was Zhuge Sega.</p>
<p>Zhuge Sega was located at Hubei but they sent their families to this place with the purpose of grasping the situation to set up a strategy and accumulate patrolling experience.</p>
<p>It didnt matter much as Zhuge Sega didnt fight much in the front lines.</p>
<p>‘Zhuge Sega!
Ju Seo Cheon got greatly excited at those words.</p>
<p>‘I dont know if its the right time but… </p></div>

<p>&lt; Superior Rank Bait (3) .<br />
The place I had gone to first, as soon as the kidnapping plan was made, was none other than ‘Happy Hamster’s’.<br />
A shabby hamster specialty pet shop that looked like it had no intention of running a business.<br />
Do Hamin was there.<br />
Once you got to know him, you realized the private detective agency was a side job and the main job was the pet shop.<br />
Though the main job gobbled up all of the money made by the side job.<br />
I grabbed Do Hamin at the shop that was decorated centered on hamsters neatly, unlike its outer appearance.<br />
‘I just helped a little in finding people!’ Wheedling the guy who shouted that wasn’t hard.<br />
It was thanks to the easily scared disposition due to being much softer than the Do Hamin I knew, maybe because he had suffered less.<br />
‘You’ve become too well known.<br />
If you keep on going like this, you’ll have to worry about your life.<br />
’ When I revealed the several people who would aim for him, based on the difficulties that Do Hamin had told me about before the regression, that guy’s complexion quickly became pale.<br />
At the words that I would take care of his protection as well as pay him a satisfying amount if he came to work under me, Do Hamin didn’t think long and nodded his head.<br />
‘If you let me open a pet shop in the building.<br />
’ I said that it was hard for ordinary people to come and go, but he said that he did internet business, so it didn’t matter.<br />
He said that he sold hamster goods near to no profit margin.<br />
It was an ordeal, in that I had to listen to the now completely relaxed Do Hamin go on impassioned speeches about the various charms of hamsters for a long time, but I was able to acquire him without much hardship.  </p>
<p>com Do Hamin would probably be checking my location regularly even now.<br />
At my words while gesturing at the lunchbox that Myeongwoo had brought while visiting, Song Taewon placidly replied.  </p>
<p>I will decline.<br />
It is delicious, though.<br />
I had already eaten dinner and the remaining were snacks.<br />
Though even that was about half empty.<br />
Everything that Myeongwoo made for me was tasty, but the yakgwa[1 were especially amazing.<br />
If I put it into Song Taewon’s mouth, wouldn’t that face that was hardened like a rock also melt down a little?.<br />
You seem excessively comfortable.<br />
As you yourself are the objective, please do not relax, even if harm will not befall you.<br />
Are you worrying about me? You should have some discontent towards me, but you are being kind.<br />
I do not have anything like discontent.<br />
From my position, it is obvious to worry about Han Yoojin-ssi.<br />
It was a wooden response.<br />
It seemed like he was acting stiffer towards me for some reason, after the conversation in the interrogation room.<br />
After giving a farewell, telling me to be careful, with a polite and businesslike attitude, Song Taewon left.<br />
When I was putting the last remaining yakgwa in my mouth while doing a crossword puzzle, the closed door opened again.<br />
Hunter Han Yoojin, due to outside circumstances, you will be moving to a different detention center.<br />
The man who entered the holding room said.<br />
His attire was the uniform of a detention-center-affiliated Hunter.  </p>
<p>I was about to grow fond of this room; that is unfortunate.<br />
But are you working even at this late a time.<br />
As there is no such thing as late nights for incidents.<br />
I put the pen down and stood up from my seat.<br />
The man held handcuffs out towards me.<br />
I obediently held out both my hands as I opened my mouth.  </p>
<p>My younger brother – the Haeyeon Guild Leader Han Yoohyun, I mean.<br />
He is AB type.<br />
I am B type.<br />
What is your blood type?The man put on an expression asking what nonsense was I saying, and then I felt the curse resistance working.<br />
Not telling others Han Yoohyun’s blood type.<br />
It was the first condition of the drawn up contracts.<br />
Breaking a contract once meant ‘the kidnappers came to find me’.<br />
We used contracts as a communication method, relying on my curse resistance.<br />
So that my state could be conveyed to Yoohyun anytime, even in circumstances where I couldn’t use a phone.<br />
Just in case I forgot, I had put a note with the list of the contracts written on it in my inventory.<br />
Since, inventory sealing also didn’t work thanks to the curse resistance.<br />
com ‘It was a feeling of having used all the contracts I would use my whole life……’ The price shouldn’t be overlaid, so all sorts of things were staked.  </p>
<p>Let us go.<br />
While going outside, we met other Hunters, too, but they all similarly didn’t show any particular response.<br />
The number of guards characteristic to the detention center for Hunters was small, but to think that all of them were unresponsive even so.<br />
Did they get a false notice that I would be moved, or were they all in on this? I really hoped it was the former.<br />
Even if it was rotten, it should be reasonably rotten.<br />
<strong><em> Noah Luire silently crossed the night’s sky.<br />
The fancy yellow gold scales didn’t lose their shine even in the darkness, but he had a hiding skill.<br />
Dragon Inside a Fog, one of the skills of the Dio Valshesis’ Twin title.<br />
It made the user’s appearance blurred and could also fool an A-Rank Hunter’s senses.<br />
[He just left the detention center.<br />
Do Hamin’s voice came out of the thin headset hung on Noah’s ears.<br />
The dragon wrapped in hazy fog slowly went one circle in the air above the detention center.<br />
His eyes saw one car entering the road.<br />
com -I found him.<br />
The car started to increase the speed, but Noah quickly caught up with just one light flap of his wings.<br />
After checking the license plate and telling it to the other person, he continued to follow behind.<br />
The car stopped at a quiet side of the road, and they switched to a different car that was on standby.<br />
When Han Yoojin appeared, Noah unconsciously moved his head a little.<br />
He could snatch him away at any time, but since he had to hold back even with him in front of his eyes, the anxiety made his scales itchy.<br />
-He moved to a different car.<br />
The license plate number is ○○U ○○○○[3.<br />
They are departing again.<br />
The place where the car arrived after driving for a long time was none other than an airport.<br />
A foreign woman went toward the car that stopped at a remote place.<br />
Right after she grabbed Han Yoojin’s arm, the two people’s appearance disappeared.<br />
-It seems like an instant movement skill was used! [Please wait a moment, about 300 meters to the northeast.<br />
And again? Noah moved following Do Hamin’s instructions.<br />
Maybe they had gone inside, because Han Yoojin couldn’t be seen from the air.<br />
The place where Noah discovered the two people again was next to a private plane.<br />
Noah quickly let the other person know the plane’s marking.<br />
-It seems like they are getting ready to take off.<br />
I will follow like this.<br />
com [I will leave it to you.<br />
It was Han Yoohyun’s voice.<br />
The golden dragon landed lightly on top of the plane.<br />
</em></strong> It was a world good for committing crimes.<br />
If you Awakened with a good rank, your power became stronger, and useful skills also appeared.<br />
The ordinary people you could wield that against were overflowing, so it was natural that there were a lot of people who felt wrong impulses.<br />
If just Awakened People appeared, without dungeons, severe social problems could’ve occurred.<br />
Of course, it wasn’t that dungeons fulfilled Awakened People’s desires so entirely that crimes didn’t occur.<br />
‘Instant movement is quite a good skill to use on nasty deeds.<br />
’ Teleportation was the best, but I hadn’t seen anybody with that except for the Dokkaebi.<br />
Even if it was just instant movement, it didn’t leave evidence and it was enough to do bad things.<br />
Like bringing me over to the plane.<br />
com ‘I didn’t know I would be made to leave the country this fast.<br />
’ Even if I left Korea, I thought it would be by sea, but to think that it was a private plane.<br />
They sure prepared a lot.<br />
I stared at the female Hunter who was sitting on the opposite side of the seat that was wide enough to make you believe that it wasn’t inside of a plane.  </p>
<p>Excuse me, can I ask where we are going.<br />
To Hong Kong.<br />
It wasn’t that far, huh.<br />
If it was Hong Kong, was it a distance you could get to with one time through Yoon Yoon’s ultra long distance gate? Though Noah was supposed to follow, so I could get his help in an emergency .<br />
‘And I have Eunhye and the earring’s shielding skill.<br />
’ I blocked my earrings from being taken by pointing out that there needed to be a way to protect me in case of an emergency.<br />
I had put Eunhye in my inventory and secretly taken it out after a frisk and put it on my ankle, hiding it with my clothes.<br />
When I pretended to be timid and quietly stayed sitting, the plane slowly started to move.<br />
‘To think my first overseas trip is kidnapping.<br />
com It was illegal departure and arrival to a country without a passport.<br />
And I didn’t have a single cent.<br />
According to the plan, it was decided that I would be kidnapped for about 3 days, so I wanted to buy a souvenir at least, if I had the time.<br />
Should I ask them to lend me some money? While I was trying hard not to doze off, the plane landed.<br />
Hong Kong was one of the places where there was a lot of damage from dungeon breaks.<br />
Above all, a big part was thanks to a considerable number of high rank Hunters being robbed to the China mainland.<br />
High rank dungeon management wasn’t done properly, so they burst open several times, and the amount of land was small, so the downtown area was uncontrollably destroyed each time.<br />
Because of that instability, the level of security had dropped at a high speed.<br />
I had heard that the anti-China sentiments had become much worse compared to before dungeons appeared.<br />
It made sense.  </p>
<p>Please come over, Hunter Han Yoojin.<br />
When I got off the plane, a middle aged man with a good appearance smiled widely and met me.<br />
What was this? As a kidnapping victim, I wasn’t sure how to respond.<br />
On top of that, he took off the handcuffs right away.<br />
Though the inventory sealing bracelet was still on.  </p>
<p>I am Henry Gregson.<br />
Gregson-ssi, who looked like an Easterner, requested for a handshake.<br />
What was this, really?.<br />
Now that you have come all the way here, please be at ease.<br />
com for a better experience.<br />
…Ah, yes.<br />
Be at ease… what bullshit was this from a kidnapping bastard? Was he telling me to get Stockholm syndrome? When we left the airport without even an inspection, a limousine was waiting.<br />
The driver opened the door for me along with a smile that was full of a heart for service.<br />
…It was an atmosphere like if I said I wanted to sightsee, they would introduce a full course on top of taking care of the travel expenses.<br />
What was this? Did I have to buy a souvenir to give to the kids?.<br />
Truthfully, I am considerably baffled; I have been kidnapped and Gregson-ssi is the kidnapper… is that correct?Gregson-ssi, who had gotten into the limousine with me, laughed.<br />
Of course it wasn’t just him alone, and Hunters that seemed like guards also rode with us.  </p>
<p>If Hunter Han Yoojin was even stat C-Rank, it would not have been that mild of an atmosphere.<br />
But there is no need to purposely persecute someone who is no different from an ordinary person.<br />
Saying so, Gregson introduced himself as an Awakened People manager.<br />
He said that he mainly found usable Awakened People from developing countries and found them places to work.  </p>
<p>Isn’t that just human trafficking.<br />
It is merely that the mediation fee is slightly expensive.<br />
I think that Hunter Han Yoojin’s fee would become the highest price of all time, so there is a lot of anticipation.<br />
com There was a lot to say, but there was nothing to say.<br />
He was truly impressively shameless.<br />
I wanted to kill this bastard and go home.<br />
I repressed the urge to immediately call Noah over, and asked that guy.  </p>
<p>Then, is Gregson-ssi the one behind kidnapping me.<br />
Would that be so? Unfortunately, I really am the mediator this time.<br />
There is a different person who acquired and delivered the goods.<br />
So it wasn’t this guy.<br />
As expected, it seemed to be a person within the country, related to the Association.<br />
They were probably steadily being discovered by Haeyeon and Seseong around now.<br />
After passing places where there were traces of destruction here and there, the limousine stopped in front of a grand hotel.<br />
When we went into the lobby that was shining glossily from the ceiling to the floor, I was more and more dumbfounded.<br />
This wasn’t what I had imagined.<br />
I mean, well, a 5 star hotel was better than a terrifying prison.  </p>
<p>You should be tired after coming a long way, so please rest well.<br />
Telling me to let him know if I needed anything at all, the slaver guy laughed.<br />
So I tried asking him to give me a smartphone for which communication was possible, but he refused, saying that wasn’t allowed.<br />
Then the place I was guided to was a highest class suite room with an incredible view.<br />
To think my first 5 star hotel suite room was the imprisonment place for my kidnapping.<br />
The way life goes, you really couldn’t know the future, huh.<br />
Yoohyun, it looks like hyung will comfortably spend time well, so don’t worry so much.  </p>
<p>So that it will not be uncomfortable during your stay, the security will be placed in front of your door.<br />
Please use the hotel service to your heart’s content.<br />
Using the swimming pool, fitness club, lounge, and other various facilities is also possible, of course.<br />
com for the best novel reading experience.<br />
Yes… yes.<br />
Fuck, I was about to say thank you.<br />
The slaver told me again to comfortably rest and then left the room.<br />
I mean, was he really leaving me alone? Of course, I wouldn’t be able to run away alone with my own strength, but still, what was this? Wondering if Noah had come nearby, I tried to go out to the terrace, but the door was firmly locked.<br />
I tried pushing and pulling several times before giving up, when a sheet of paper stuck lightly to the opposite side of the glass door.<br />
[Are you okay? They were letters that were shaky like the work of a young child who had just started to learn how to write Korean.<br />
I couldn’t see him, but it was Noah, huh.<br />
‘I am okay.<br />
OK[4.<br />
’ I thought there might be security cameras, so I just moved my mouth and nodded my head.<br />
[Careful.<br />
I am here.<br />
He’s here? Um, was he standing guard on the terrace? He should just go sleep.<br />
I couldn’t say anything to him and just smiled.<br />
com I went to the sofa, and while hiding my hand with a cushion, I took out a Tillira branch[5 from my inventory and broke it.<br />
Not breaking the Tillira branch that Yoohyun gave me.<br />
It was the condition of the fifth contract.<br />
The curse resistance came into effect.<br />
The contract’s meaning was ‘I’m well, I’m safe’.<br />
*** The next morning, after I had slept well since it was a comfortable expensive room, a guest came to find me.<br />
It was a familiar face that I didn’t know I would meet here.<br />
Advertisements.<br />
…Why are you here.<br />
I’m a guest staying here.<br />
The Seseong Guild Leader said.<br />
What was he talking about, what the heck.<br />
[1 type of fried wheat-based cookie made from honey [2 referring to an idiom that goes ‘there is meaning and bones in words’, so since this is a crossword and usually the answer to a crossword riddle is a word, the answer is probably 언중유골(言中有骨), which is the same thing literally and metaphorically (it’s the krn pronunciation of a presumably chn idiom); they both mean ‘there is genuine meaning hidden in words’ or ‘even insignificant words have meaning behind them’.<br />
The crossword answer is just conjecture on my part, though.<br />
com [3 the plate number was all censored except for one character, so I just put a random letter where it was in the raws.  </p>

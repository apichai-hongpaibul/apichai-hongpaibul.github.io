<p>Chap 138 Snowfall (2) The tree from which snow fell was the fifth origin, and was where the star-reckoning bird that took Yoohyun’s body stayed.
However, I could not see the white-feathered bird, but my brother was quietly lying on the snow plane.
The human body looked so small between the tree roots thick as a frozen mountain.
I could probably see him so clearly because this was a dream.
‘He might be cold.
’ That was the first thought that came to my head.
I knew that the dead could not feel the cold, but this was a dream.
He might still be alive here.
His face was only a bit pale and he looked asleep.
I could not see any wounds, and the snowflakes that lightly covered the body were unblemished white.
So he might open his eyes if I woke him up.
‘Yoohyun.
’ However, I could not approach him or say anything.
This did not need to be such a cliché nightmare.
I had enough of not being able to do anything but watch in real life, so I hoped I could move somewhat in a dream.
I never really wanted all that much.
I felt sick inside as I continued to blink stupidly at the never-ending snowfall that swam the air as it would last forever.
An especially large snowflake floated in between them.
com for the best novel reading experience -Peep, peep! It was the chick and not a snowflake as a small white bird was flapping its tiny wings to come to me.
I saw the white bird fly through the white snow.
-Peep! ‘Hello.
’ The chick peeped when it came in front of me, and I could not hug it because I could not move.
What was happening to my body? Was I simply observing without a form like a typical dream? The chick had been flying in circles in front of me and then flew away.
It flew down slowly after shrugging off the snowflakes that kept falling on its small body.
The chick flopped on the piled snow and rose to walk to where Yoohyun was.
-Pee-ep! The baby bird jumped over the piled snow and breathed heavily.
Why was it not flying? Did it use all the magic stones in the item? Items with special effects were categorized to either those that consumed the magic of the user or those that consumed the magic of the magic stones included in the item.
The item the chick used was the latter because flying skills consumed a lot of magic.
com The chick’s magic levels seemed to be higher than I thought if it was using teleport skills.
Oh right, I almost forgot that this was a dream.
-Peep, peep! The chick finally reached Yoohyun and stepped on the limp arm to jump onto his chest.
My heart lurched as Yoohyun’s black hair brushed his pale brow.
However, nothing else happened, and it was probably because of the wind.
-Peep! The chick stared up at me on top of Yoohyun’s chest.
Yes, I know that he will not wake up.
I closed my eyes and opened them in the midst of peeping sounds.
-Peep, peep.</p>
<p>Hey.
I rose and wrapped my hands around the chick that was sitting down next to me.
Why were its feathers wet? I saw that the light of the screen that we used instead of a window was foggy.
The rain was falling in the garden, and I could hear the sound of raindrops through the speaker.</p>
<p>com for the best novel reading experience -Peep.
The end of the small beak delved into my hand as if it was hungry.
If it was so tired, It had used a skill, and I worried for a bit what the chick would face when going out without letting anyone know.</p>
<p>You shouldn’t go out alone.
A bad person might get you.
I firmly told him as I took out a magic stone for it to eat.
The chick would not understand, but it would return if there were enough magic thanks to the teleport skill.
I thought it was now winter for a moment because of the dream.
Why did it have to be a snowy place where it was lonely and cold? I wished that I could have moved at least once to hold him in my arms.</p>
<p>Even though it’s summer, let’s dry you up.
-Peep! I took out a dry towel holding the chick and wiped the white feathers, and used a pet dryer to finish the job.</p>
<p>Did you wake up?I heard my brother’s voice as soon as I turned off the dryer, which reminded me of yesterday.
I had completely forgotten.
I unplugged the dryer and placed it back in the drawer before turning around with the chick in my arms.
I turned on the poison resistance skill again.
Did Hyunjae Sung tell you?
Yes.
Yoohyun seemed to be watching for my response.
You really should not give other people sleep inducers.
However- 
Why do you have sleep inducers? Don’t you sleep well?
I don’t use them, and I sleep enough.
You slept well in Hong Kong.
Even an S class should sleep well.
Yoohyun became silent for a moment.</p>
<p>Aren’t you angry?
Next time, please let me know before you give me one.
It seemed effective.
com Except for the dream, I seemed to have slept well, and most of my fatigue was gone.</p>
<p>Hey.
What exactly did Hyunjae Sung say? He doesn’t know the specifics.
Why are you avoiding your gaze?I did not realize I was doing it, but I was unable to face Yoohyun’s head-on.</p>
<p>You are angry.
I don’t become angry about these kinds of things.
Then?I raised my head and stared back at my brother.
He was young.
While a twenty-five-year-old was not that old, Yoohyun was still younger.
I smiled at his aloof yet uncertain face.
I’m sorry that I kept silent when I told you I wouldn’t keep secrets.
Come here.
I lightly hugged my brother with one arm and let him go.</p>
<p>What time is it? Let’s talk during breakfast.
* * * I prepared a simple breakfast.
Yoohyun said he would help, but I told him to stay.
While I was not an expert, I had many years of experience in housework.
Anyway, the only dish I cooked was sunny side eggs because the other side dishes were the ones I took out of the refrigerator, and for the rice I only needed to wash and press the electronic rice cooker button.</p>
<p>He really is quick.
How did he know where the magic stone was in?I clicked my tongue after Yoohhyun told me what Hyunjae Sung had said.</p>
<p>They are the cracked magic stone of the Diarma and a magic stone of an SS class dragon.
This is a skill to create a new dragon species by fusing magic stones.
If the skill works, it will follow me, and the class will be at least S class.
However, the fact that there were no changes was what unnerved me.
Since the time needed for fusing per class differ, it would take a long time, but it still was too long.</p>
<p>The side effect is monsters coming after me, but I did not expect that.
If the dragon is born, does the wound heal?
No, it remains the same.
Don’t use the skill anymore.
Yoohyun was firm.</p>
<p>But it’s a shame not to use it, and having a scar won’t bother me.
I want to remove that right now if I could.
com for the best novel reading experience My little brother muttered to take better care of myself and picked a steamed shishito pepper with his chopsticks.
Yoohyun stopped moving after taking a bite as I looked at him with some anticipation 
Isn’t it tasty?
Y.
.
es.
Myungwoo made it.
Huh.
Yoohyun spoke in a sour voice.
He refused my offer of bringing some of Myungwoo’s side dishes but might have changed his opinion now.</p>
<p>Taste other dishes and tell me if they suit you.
I’ll have them refilled.
No, it’s all right.
Yoohyun’s voice seemed irritated, and he only ate the eggs and ignored the other dishes afterward.
Don’t be picky.
I gave him my eggs and thought I should bring other side dishes, maybe some laver.</p>
<p>My fear resistance class is a C right now.
What?
Taewon Song had a skill that could lower the class level of another skill.
I felt bad for Taewon Song, but I needed to tell Yoohyun this so his skill level would not be lowered by it.
If the skill lasted half a day for an A class, it would last at least an hour for an S class.
If a resistance skill’s class level fell, it might be dangerous.</p>
<p>I’m surprised that there’s a skill like that, with that sort of effect.
That’s because I shared the skill that multiplies the attack skill effect by two.
Normally the level decreases by three classes, so be careful as an S class skill will become a C class.
Since it applies by long contact, you would not be affected by the skill during battle.
Stop sharing skills.
You know it’s dangerous.
I’m going to write a contract and then share now.
com for a better experience I would have to modify it, though.
My little brother cleaned after we finished our breakfast.
He really is kind and sweet.
Why was he not in a relationship? Was he too perfect? [Last night, the dungeon break that occurred in OO mountain in Gangseo-gu, Seoul… There was a special program about the dungeon break that occurred last night when I turned on the TV.
Except for regular programs, everyone was talking about the dungeon break, and there was nothing about me.
It was probable since it had been a long time since the last dungeon break.
‘It has not ended yet.
’ Someone intentionally broke the dungeon, and if this information was revealed, then it was like jumping into fire doused in oil.
Why are they hanging themselves with the rope of salvation I gave them instead of retiring peacefully?
I have to backtrack the honey on the market and select those who did not reply to me.
A smart move would be telling me that retirement was forthcoming.
The first thing I needed to do was to track the honey, and unfortunately, the only person I could think of was Hyunjae Sung.
‘’There have to be hunters in Sesung who can gain information from people or corpses.
Since they took the corpse in Hong Kong, it was definite.
I did not want to ask Yerim to do it, and anyway, it would be too late since coming out of the dungeon would take at least a week to ten days.
com What should I give him? Should I offer him my information about magic stone combinations? He would find a customized riding beast an attractive idea.
‘It’s difficult to find a high-class electricity resistant monster.
’ The beast needed to be an S class for the Sesung guild master, and I would not offer him this for tracking the honey transaction route.
I would only give him information that it might be possible since I did not know if the skill would succeed and the extent I could combine monsters.
It seemed like a fraud, but Hyunjae Sung could afford it if he had so much.
Yoohyun had come out of the kitchen and glanced at the TV.
He then sat down on the sofa.</p>
<p>Aren’t you going to the guild? They will be bustling because of the dungeon break.
I’m still in the dungeon on all accounts.
Since it would do no good if people knew I came out using a gate stone, I’m laying low until the dungeon conquest is complete.
You’ll also be staying at home until your fear resistance skill is restored, right?I avoided Yoohyun’s confident gaze.</p>
<p>No, I need to keep busy.
It’s evident that the dungeon break is to cover me, and I need to do something about it.
Also, you don’t need fear resistance to go about daily routines.
A C class is more than enough as civilians don’t have them at all.
People will say that a C class skill is more than enough.
My brother’s expression turned annoyed, and I was sorry to make him housekeep, but he could use the rest.
Then, I’ll go along with you.
Wasn’t the Hayeon guild master participating in a dungeon conquest?Yoohyun phoned somewhere instead of replying.
A moment later, Simyeong Seok came in dragging a man in his early twenties.</p>
<p>Weren’t you in a dungeon now?It was Minyui Kim, a Haeyeon B class hunter who recommended a pub for Sunghan Kim before.
Yoohyun smiled warmly as Minyui Kim stared at him with surprised eyes.</p>
<p>Let me borrow your identity for a week.
Yes?
Since you’re on vacation, you don’t need it.
You took a leave too.
I took it to go on a Europe trip.
com Yoohyun picked up glasses while he gazed at Minyui Kim, stepping away from him.
Simyeong Seok put forth a pill in front of him.</p>
<p>You only need to sleep and wake up.
I reserved the plane tickets and the hotel already!
We will compensate three times the amount and extend your leave.
Minyui Kim complained but still accepted the pill.
I am sorry, but do not worry.
I will try my best to prevent my brother from causing a racket.</p>

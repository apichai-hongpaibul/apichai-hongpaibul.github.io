    <h1 id="the-s-classes-that-i-raised">The S-Classes That I Raised .</h1>
<p>… Hyung, are you okay?That guy said.<br />
His side was ripped open and his guts were spilling out, and he was asking if I was ok.<br />
He was on the verge of death yet his face was only a little pale.<br />
His calm look annoyed me.<br />
I sat on the floor and looked up at my brother without saying anything.<br />
He was always interfering with my work.<br />
He was better than the dirty me, so people had always told me to stay put and behave, to not hold onto his thigh.<br />
They weren’t wrong to say that because eventually I had broken this big and reliable thigh.<br />
However.  </p>
<p>……Why are you here?A blunt voice came out of my mouth on this old subject.<br />
Why did you come to such a shit place for someone you don’t even know? We were anything but close.<br />
If we ever ran into each other, there would only be a cold breeze.<br />
When my leg bones had been shattered, he did not come to the hospital to see me even once.<br />
When I went to him to request for help to fix my broken leg, he coldly turned me down and had me dragged out.<br />
That day, after being kicked out I was forced to take the money he gave me.<br />
I have never talked to him ever since.<br />
He laughed bitterly at my question.<br />
Why are you here, fuck.<br />
Even though I thought he was the type of person who would bite the hand that feeds, a curse still emerged from my mouth.<br />
He had a lot of expectations on his shoulders but he still gave his life to save a useless family member.<br />
Crazy son of a bitch.<br />
Since when were we that friendly? If you’re dead and on the news, damn it, I’ll just swear a few times and then forget about it.<br />
But what did you do? I was angry.<br />
I was angry and irritated by my patheticness, not him.<br />
Yes, I’ve always been an ugly older brother.<br />
Even in this situation, I’m still a person with a garbage brain filled with complaints and an inferiority complex.<br />
So just let me die in a corner of a Dungeon! Why did you come?!.<br />
Listen to me, hyung.<br />
That guy said, avoiding my question.<br />
Lauchitas falls asleep within five-hour cycles.<br />
If you hide for an hour, it will eventually go to sleep.<br />
Then you just have to get out through the entrance.<br />
I’ve taken care of all the lesser monsters so as long as you do not touch Lauchitas, you will be safe.<br />
He then held out a small blue stone to me.<br />
It was a gatestone that provided a way out of a closed dungeon.<br />
It can only be used near the entrance and is a very valuable item that could only be used one time by one person.<br />
I did not take the gatestone and pretended to be uncaring.  </p>
<p>Good for you.<br />
Now use it.<br />
He laughed at my words.  </p>
<p>I’ve got mine.<br />
I won’t use this.<br />
…Now that you’re one of the best Hunters in Korea, you’re carrying several of those precious gatestones.<br />
I reluctantly accepted the gatestone.<br />
It was only then that he took his eyes off me and looked at his wounds.<br />
Without the strength of his skills, he would have long collapsed and died.  </p>
<p>com for a better experience.<br />
No, I don’t.<br />
I have a small potion, but I don’t think that’s going to work.<br />
Lauchitas has a powerful curse on its claws.<br />
He laughed again.<br />
I didn’t know how to laugh with him.<br />
But that kind of calmness soon reached its limit.<br />
His knees bent and his body fell forward.<br />
I reflexively caught the upper half of his body.<br />
The smell of blood that I hadn’t felt so far stung my nose.<br />
It was awful.<br />
I thought I got used to the smell of blood as I walked around the dungeon but it brought me to my knees.<br />
I felt sick.<br />
I was tempted to throw away the body in my arms and flee.  </p>
<p>……hey.<br />
I could hardly hear the sound of breathing.<br />
There was no answer.<br />
com I couldn’t laugh.  </p>
<p>……are you dead?My voice was shaking.<br />
It’s none of my business whether this asshole dies or not.  </p>
<p>Han Yuhyun.<br />
Are you dead?Damn, this stupid son of a bitch.<br />
I’d be damned if I survived by myself.<br />
I’m sure that there were a lot of guys who would want to burn the scumbag who killed his younger brother.  </p>
<p>You’re going to screw with me to the end?I muttered in vain.<br />
Up to this day, he’s been interrupting me in everything I do.<br />
It is now time to hide.<br />
Dirty to the end, really.<br />
[Effect of ‘Caregiver’ title has been activated.<br />
com Caregiver’s Additional Skill — Final Reward The skills and abilities of Awakened ‘Han Yuhyun’ have been transferred with twice the efficiency.<br />
Duration — 01:00 A notice popped up, confirming his death.<br />
As one of the Additional Skills of my title, when a target who had been given the growth buff died, the target’s skills and abilities can be transferred for one hour It also doubled in power.<br />
As his power filled my body, some of his memories were also passed on.<br />
‘My brother is an F-Level Awakener.<br />
This son of a bitch even to the end— ‘So he cannot be involved with me.<br />
com for the best novel reading experience Yuhyun was talking to someone.<br />
He seemed a little sad.<br />
‘It’s already damaged, but in the future we need to be even more distant.<br />
Because Awakeners who qualified to become Hunters are not protected by the law.<br />
’ ‘If my brother becomes my weakness, they will no doubt go after him.<br />
’ …who the hell are they? ‘Damn it, dispose of all of those bastards!’ It was when my leg had been broken.<br />
He was angry.<br />
And then he was sad again.<br />
‘No.<br />
Tell him… healing is not possible.<br />
It would be better for him.<br />
I kicked him out… But he’s still my brother, I cannot help but help him……’ ‘Hyung, I’m sorry.<br />
com ‘Please don’t go into the dungeon.<br />
’ ‘Hyung.<br />
’ My brother’s memory tightened my throat.<br />
The entire area was silent, but the sound of.<br />
hyungstill hurt my ears.<br />
The body was cold and stiff.<br />
I was going crazy.<br />
As expected, this fellow had covered for me until the very end.<br />
What are you protecting me for? The older brother is me.<br />
I had lost my parents at an early age, dropped out of school, and took care of my younger brother, raising him.  </p>
<p>Damn him! Did he think I was going to regret this?It’s your fault that you didn’t say a word.<br />
I carefully laid my younger brother’s body onto the floor.<br />
His face looked relaxed.<br />
If I leave alone, it would be the same as when I came in.  </p>
<p>I’m not going to cry.<br />
com Until the end, that selfish guy just did whatever he wanted; why would I cry for him? It was a waste of tears.<br />
I got up.<br />
When I looked at the status window, I saw the increased number of skills.<br />
They were all top quality, even the double buffs.<br />
Laughter broke out.<br />
Just one hour.<br />
For just an hour, I had become the strongest person in the world at the cost of my younger brother’s life.  </p>
<p>Damn it, what can you do with only one hour?It would be better for Han Yuhyun to be live longer for 40 or 50 more years.<br />
Even if Yuhyun became a grandfather, he would still be a lot stronger than me.<br />
How could it be compared to this one-time, one-hour presentation?.<br />
Stupid bastard.<br />
That stupid fucking bastard.<br />
My brother’s stupidity brought tears to my eyes.<br />
The title of ‘genius’ was a waste on him.<br />
He was the world’s biggest fool.  </p>
<p>Gigant Shield.<br />
com for a better experience As soon as I used the skill, a faint golden light wrapped around my body.<br />
Originally, it was a shield that couldn’t stop Lauchitas’ claws, but now that it received the double buffs, I would survive even if I was bitten by the creature itself.<br />
This, is all yours.<br />
So I am going to avenge you.<br />
I walked slowly out of a gap in the wall where I was hiding.<br />
I could see a giant monster lurking at the far end of the wide corridor.<br />
Lauchitas.<br />
Grade 1 polyp.<br />
The Dragon King of Poison and Curse.<br />
It had only appeared twice so far and both times were deemed as a non-combatant because its Dungeon door was closed.<br />
The red dragon with three heads was looking at me.<br />
Among the three heads, the middle one’s eyes had been burnt out.<br />
The Lauchitas was very resilient, but it seemed that even it could not recover in such a short period of time from the injuries caused by Yuhyun’s blood.<br />
Yeah, my younger brother’s great.<br />
Now I have double the abilities of that great younger brother Fuck.<br />
You’re dead.  </p>

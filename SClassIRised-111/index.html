<p>&lt; Greeting (2) .<br />
Seeing the dangling head speak felt bizarre.<br />
I did see undead in dungeons, but there weren’t any that spoke.  </p>
<p>Is that possibly one of those well-known zombies? The ones you get infected by if you get bit.<br />
I don’t know what it is, so hyung, stay back.<br />
Yoohyun said, stepping one foot forward.<br />
Just then, the zombie or whatever flapped its mouth again.  </p>
<p>The appearance is absurd, everyone.<br />
Wait a moment.<br />
And then, Yoon Kyeongsoo’s appearance changed.  </p>
<p>Ah, limited edition Bunny Bunny Bear.<br />
…Hyung?Yerim shouted happily, and Yoohyun mumbled, taken aback.<br />
In the meantime, I couldn’t say anything.<br />
com A bit away, between the collapsed building wreckage, Yoohyun was standing there.<br />
My younger brother who was a little older, his outline a little clearer, and his height a little taller.<br />
Without even me knowing, I stretched out my hand, and grabbed the arm of the Yoohyun in front of me.<br />
The twenty-five-year-old younger brother smiled.<br />
I didn’t know who they were but it was a bad hobby.<br />
Or was I the problem? Since it seemed like the appearance that each person saw was different.  </p>
<p>Hyung, are you okay?Yoohyun asked worriedly, but I couldn’t turn my gaze away.<br />
Yoohyun slowly came over.<br />
He came closer to about ten steps away.<br />
That thing was fake.<br />
I knew that better than anyone else.<br />
I couldn’t help but know.  </p>
<p>…Should I, get rid if it?Yoohyun said, turning his eyes away to do his utmost to not look at Yoohyun… no, that thing.  </p>
<p>……No.<br />
Even though it wasn’t real, how could I watch something like that, fuck.<br />
Is it not an appearance comfortable for talking?That thing said.<br />
On top of that, the voice was the same, too.<br />
Next to me, Yerim shouted that ‘it cried bba-oo, how cute!’.  </p>
<p>If you know, then change right now.<br />
Yoon Kyeongsoo with his head dangling was much better.<br />
When I replied, grinding my teeth, Yoohyun, shit, that thing gave a small laugh.  </p>
<p>You’ve probably guessed, but it’s not an appearance that I want.<br />
It’s hyung who wanted to see it.<br />
…Don’t laugh with that face.<br />
It was slowly getting harder to endure, but thankfully, that guy’s appearance changed.<br />
The size became much smaller.<br />
It became smaller, but the target that it molded itself after wasn’t different.<br />
It was still Yoohyun.<br />
This time, I would go crazy for a different reason.  </p>
<p>Ah, really, crap…How cute.<br />
My younger brother who was around six or seven smiled big.<br />
He had soft hair like a puppy’s, and the round cheeks were pearly.<br />
Small hands, and obviously, small fingers, and his feet were small, too.<br />
Yoo-Yoohyun.<br />
Grab onto me.<br />
What.<br />
I want to run out, wow, really, seriously……I wanted to pet his head.<br />
I wanted to hug him.<br />
I wanted to touch his cheek.<br />
Even though I knew it was actually a corpse, I wanted to run over right now.<br />
How could he be so lovable and cute?.<br />
Ahjussi, exactly what are you seeing.<br />
…Yoohyun when he was younger.<br />
Oh, I want to see it, too! I also want to see when ahjussi was younger! Change, Bunny Bunny Bear! It’s not changing.<br />
Then, dance!I flexed my hand, and then took out my cell phone.<br />
Just in case, I tried taking a photo, but I got the zombie.<br />
Shit.<br />
A video didn’t work either, as expected, shit.  </p>
<p>Yoohyuuun.<br />
Hyung, I’m here.<br />
At the slightly sullen voice, I turned to look at my brother.<br />
When I saw the twenty-year-old after looking at the six-to-seven-year-old, the reminiscence felt new.<br />
He was that small, but now he had grown this big.  </p>
<p>Our Yoohyun really grew a lot.<br />
Please get a hold of yourself, ahjussi.<br />
You have a completely vacant face.<br />
The kid is cute.<br />
Just in case, just once, couldn’t I try petting just his head once? Of course I couldn’t.<br />
I didn’t know what that was.<br />
I should get a hold of myself.  </p>
<p>Is this also hard for us to talk, hyung-ah[1.<br />
Yoohyuuun.<br />
Ahjussi!Yoohyun and Yerim grabbed me at the same time.<br />
Shit, let’s calm down.<br />
But I couldn’t calm down.<br />
Should I close my eyes instead? But there weren’t any photos left of when he was at that age, so it was a waste.<br />
And he was moving, and blinking, and speaking.<br />
My heart hurt.<br />
He was really cute.<br />
Look how small his shoes are.<br />
I wanted to buy him something tasty.<br />
Though he wasn’t real, though he was fake.<br />
Shit, at any rate, it was the same that photos and videos weren’t the real thing either.<br />
Did I not have anything to feed him with?.<br />
Looks like it won’t work.<br />
We’ll just have to talk with the original appearance for hyung-ah.<br />
What? Wait!Young Yoohyun disappeared, and Yoon Kyeongsoo’s creaking corpse took his place instead.<br />
To think that this would happen.<br />
My younger brother.  </p>
<p>I’ll greet you again, everyone.<br />
I’m a type of replacement for the lizard’s owner.<br />
The corpse said.<br />
Yoohyun frowned, and Yerim tilted her head.  </p>
<p>It’s going ‘bba-oo bba-oo’ but I can’t tell what it’s saying.<br />
com Did it not sound like human words to Yerim? It seemed like it only transmitted words to people who knew about the filial duty addicts.  </p>
<p>You sure appeared fast.<br />
It looks like there wasn’t much to do for the transfer of duties.<br />
The reason why there wasn’t, was that he went and died.<br />
At any rate, there’s someone whose contract was maintained, so I came to greet you for a moment like this.<br />
Could you let me know how and who killed the lizard.<br />
Would I tell you that.<br />
It’s like this, as expected.<br />
There isn’t much I know about this side either… Clumsily lunging doesn’t suit my disposition.<br />
So, should we simply make a bet?It was welcome that Diarma hadn’t sent proper information.<br />
It was especially a relief that they didn’t know much about before the regression, and about me.<br />
But it seemed like the contracts that were made before were continued over to that zombie as they were.<br />
I should also get rid of Choi Sukwon, or at the least, make him get de-cursed.<br />
Would there be other people who had contracted?.<br />
What kind of bet are you talking about.<br />
I didn’t chose yet.<br />
I have to look around here first.<br />
It seems like there’s no reason for us to accept the bet.<br />
The zombie shrugged its shoulders.  </p>
<p>Or, do you want to keep on being disrupted? I’m not the type that takes it easy like that, either.<br />
But the lizard owner died and I don’t know those circumstances either, so even the preparation is lacking.<br />
However, that doesn’t mean I can’t do anything.<br />
Yoon Kyeongsoo’s head let out a sigh.<br />
At the same time, it dangled a lot to the point of it being admirable that it didn’t just fall off.<br />
It was disgusting to look at, really.  </p>
<p>I don’t have any intention of risking my life, so let’s just each go safely.<br />
Hm? It’s ending it with just once.<br />
Whether it’s rock-paper-scissors or solving mazes or a duel or whatever.<br />
Then I’ll consider it as having done all I should to do and draw back, and everyone can diligently block dungeons.<br />
How about it, it’s good, right?The zombie’s hand lifted up and gestured to around my chest.<br />
And then it spoke.  </p>
<p>Diarma’s successor-nim.<br />
You’re saying annoying things.<br />
I glanced at Yoohyun, but he didn’t show any particular reaction.<br />
It seemed like the contents that he heard were also different from mine, like with Yerim.<br />
The lizard owner was a bit dumb.<br />
But his ability was usable.<br />
He was a guy whose skill in combining curse and poison dragon types was pretty good.<br />
Though I don’t know how you learned that ability.<br />
Looking at how that zombie talked, it seemed like it was higher up than Diarma.<br />
Of course, it could be a bluff, or the relationship between the two could’ve been bad so it was putting him down, but it was better to overestimate an enemy’s abilities rather than underestimate.<br />
‘And it’s certain that it has a hallucination-like mind-related skill.<br />
’ The lizard bastard also used that type of skill when he was pulling me over.<br />
Did the filial duty addicts have a lot of guys with mind-related skills? I should ask Myeongwoo for mind-related resistance items.<br />
Couldn’t I extort items from the immoral people?.<br />
Obviously it wouldn’t be good to be disrupted in the middle of the busy mess of blocking dungeons, but I’ll give a reply after I hear the conditions for the bet.<br />
Alright, good.<br />
Convey it to the immoral people, too.<br />
You’re in contact with them, right?I hesitated for a moment and then nodded my head.<br />
If I said no while having Diarma’s ability, it would sound too much like an obvious lie.  </p>
<p>As expected.<br />
But I wonder why it’s you.<br />
There’s even an appetizing kid right next to you.<br />
His talents are outstanding and he also has an elemental.<br />
I like him.<br />
What about staking him on the bet.<br />
Don’t say something crazy and if you’re done with your business, get lost.<br />
com Why did these bastards keep on aiming for someone’s younger brother? The zombie smiled and collapsed.<br />
At the same time, Yoohyun and Yerim turned to look at me.  </p>
<p>I only heard it going ‘bba-oo’.<br />
Ahjussi, it seems like you talked with it – what did it say? Will a zombie infection start from now.<br />
No.<br />
That kind of thing would…n’t happen? Probably.<br />
I couldn’t be sure.<br />
Even dungeons appeared, so there was no reason zombies couldn’t show up.  </p>
<p>Yoohyun, what did you hear.<br />
Things like it’s those guys’ replacement, and questions like how did I get free of the contract.<br />
It asked if I didn’t have any intention of making a new contract, so I just refused.<br />
What about hyung.<br />
I…I trailed off, looking at Yerim who was looking at me with eyes sparkling with curiosity.<br />
I did have to tell Yerim, too.<br />
But I was caught in the mermaid queen’s words that the more it was known, the bigger the influence became.<br />
It would be better to ask the immoral people specifically about sharing the information.  </p>
<p>Let’s go back first and talk-.<br />
Right!The corpse jumped up again.<br />
The head that dangled at the rough movement finally fell off and rolled on the floor.<br />
Whether it did or not, the voice continued.  </p>
<p>I forgot I was going to give a present before going.<br />
This body’s owner’s value is considerably big, so you’ll be able to get a good present.<br />
Do well.<br />
Right afterwards, Yoon Kyeongsoo’s corpse melted down.<br />
And above that, a gate appeared.<br />
A supersaturated dungeon gate that was right before bursting.<br />
I quickly grabbed Yoohyun, who was about to go in as soon as he saw it, and spoke.  </p>
<p>Hey! You don’t even know what’s inside.<br />
I have a gate stone, so if I think it’s dangerous, I’ll come out immediately.<br />
Then me going in would be better instead! I have an item that Myeongwoo gave me.<br />
Hunter Bak Yerim, I will leave hyung to you.<br />
That younger brother didn’t even pretend he didn’t hear and pulled me off.<br />
Then, Yerim grabbed my shoulder from behind.<br />
Even if you use a damage nullification item, if you just go in, then it’s the end.<br />
See, you can’t even move if you’re grabbed.<br />
…That was true.<br />
Yoohyun placed his hand on the gate.<br />
But as if he was touching a wall, he was blocked.  </p>
<p>Even though it looks like supersaturated gate.<br />
It looks like it was deactivated.<br />
Is there somebody inside?Would there be cause for it to be so? Anyways, you couldn’t go in.  </p>
<p>First, let’s draw back, and prepare for a dungeon break.<br />
At my words, the two of them nodded their heads.<br />
I had drawn back while I took out my cell phone in order to convey the situation to Song Taewon, who should be nearby.<br />
Kooreureung The gate shook.<br />
Then, what poured out from inside it was deep blue water.<br />
com Yoohyun snatched me up and jumped into the air.<br />
Yerim also immediately used her flight skill.<br />
Kwakwakwa, along with the noisy sound, the water that poured out without end swallowed up the isolation center building in an instant.<br />
A whirlpool formed where the gate was and the ground became dug up.<br />
In the space of a blink, a small lake formed.<br />
The gate was in the middle of that, like an eye.<br />
No, was it really an actual dungeon gate? The gate that was floating on top of the water soon sank down underneath.<br />
Within the confusion, we got out of the lake, first.  </p>
<p>What has happened?Kang Soyoung, who was standing at the edges of the lake, where the water was barely touching, saw us and asked.<br />
It seemed like the people who were near the barricade were swept up by the water.<br />
Thankfully, it was normal water, so we saw them swim out without having gotten much damage.  </p>
<p>I would like to explain, but I do not know very well either.<br />
It seemed like there weren’t any monsters, and I hadn’t seen a dungeon break where only water poured out, even before the regression.<br />
Normally, only monsters poured out.<br />
Song Taewon also appeared and asked for the complete story, but there were very few things we could explain.<br />
It felt wrong to just leave it alone, but even so, there wasn’t anything we could do about the lake.<br />
While we were all at a loss wondering if we had to take out the water at least, Kang Soyoung spoke.  </p>
<p>Doesn’t it seem like it became larger than before? The lake.<br />
com It was as she said.<br />
The lake was slowly, but without stopping, getting bigger.<br />
It was a slow speed, but if we left it like this, we couldn’t know how far the water would go.<br />
.  </p>
<p>…It would have been better instead if monsters had come out, like normal.<br />
Song Taewon’s expression was rigidly stiff.<br />
The other people also had similar faces, as expected.<br />
In the middle of that, Yerim shot her hand up.  </p>
<p>Since water came out, couldn’t we go inside the gate now? I will go check.<br />
I have my earrings.<br />
The one that has the effect where I can move freely in water.<br />
I mean, Yerim.<br />
Still, it wouldn’t do for it to be you alone.<br />
[1 ‘hyung-ah’ is a childish way of saying ‘hyung’ tn: apparently the author has recently done revisions to ch 1~75 and is planning on revisions to ch 76~100, but i will not be redoing any translations as of now.  </p>

<p>&lt; Like a Shrimp (1) .<br />
Whew, in the end, I figured out another case.<br />
Now all I had to do was finish the contract and Awaken her.  </p>
<p>Saying something I never say, it’s embarrassing as hell.<br />
Quickly sign, I’ll Awaken you.<br />
Okay.<br />
Ah, it’s so funny.<br />
Don’t laugh.<br />
Even ahjussi’s neck is red.<br />
You’re difficult to handle too, okay?Giggling, Bak Yerim signed the contract.<br />
As soon as the two signature lines were filled, the contract glowed weakly.<br />
Continuing, the surface became slippery as if it was covered in lamination.<br />
As if she was fascinated, Bak Yerim touched the contract.  </p>
<p>It looks like you can’t modify it.<br />
It wouldn’t do if you could modify it.<br />
com Taking back the contract, I put it back in the inventory.<br />
With this, the preparation was complete.  </p>
<p>Then, I’m going to use the Awakening skill.<br />
Ah, wait a moment.<br />
She shook her hand and sat up straight as if she was going to go into meditation.<br />
Then, she took a deep breath.  </p>
<p>Will I Awaken right away.<br />
If your luck is good.<br />
At the longest it’ll take a week.<br />
The Auspicious Seed-Leaf skill was applied immediately but I deliberately choose a week’s time.<br />
Since I didn’t know if I would be able to apply the keyword immediately like this time, when I Awaken a different person later.  </p>
<p>Okay, please do it!There was no need to be that nervous.<br />
I used the Auspicious Seed-Leaf optimized Awakening skill toward Bak Yerim.<br />
And then, shortly.<br />
M-message Window really came up! Ahjussi! Rank, how do I check my rank.<br />
Think about opening your Status Window.<br />
You can say it outloud too.<br />
Status Window! Huh? Wow!Bak Yerim’s mouth dropped open.<br />
Her whole face looked as if the word ‘astonishment’ was engraved into it.<br />
That’s right, it was certainly shocking enough.<br />
Stat rank S with skills that were as much as SS.<br />
An incredibly excited Yerim screamed and grabbed the table with her han-.<br />
Ahjussi! I’m S-!-Pajik! Huh? The table broke? I mean, did she dig her hand into it? The thick surface had sunken in in the shape of a hand.<br />
Oh my.  </p>
<p>com for a better experience.<br />
D-don’t move!Ah, shit.<br />
Yoohyun definitely told me that C-Ranks and higher couldn’t immediately adjust to their suddenly changed physical abilities.<br />
Since Yerim was S-Rank… I messed up.  </p>
<p>Right now, your strength is a lot stronger than before.<br />
So don’t touch anything.<br />
Okay.<br />
Yes, yes.<br />
Okay.<br />
Let’s go out carefully.<br />
Move very slowly.<br />
Think about walking slowly, without even making a sound.<br />
Yerim stood from her seat slowly and carefully.<br />
It was a precarious movement as if she was walking on a tightrope.<br />
Watching this, I felt anxious as if in front of a young child who could fall off at any moment.<br />
This was the 1st floor, with no basement, so that was a relief at least.<br />
Even if the ground broke, people wouldn’t get hurt.  </p>
<p>Slowly, step by step.<br />
Yes, like that.<br />
I think I’ve gotten a little used to it.<br />
Still, you can’t hurry.<br />
Apparently it takes at least a day.<br />
Not looking away from her, I opened the sliding door.<br />
After putting on my shoes[1, I took care of Yerim’s sneakers.<br />
Her sneakers were very old.<br />
And they looked big compared to Yerim’s feet.<br />
At least buy her new shoes instead of handing over used ones.  </p>
<p>I’ll put them on for you so give me your feet.<br />
Okay.<br />
Uh… I’m a little uneasy about standing on one foot though.<br />
Then sit down carefully.<br />
Slowly-.<br />
Ack, a slight handprint was left on the floor.<br />
But unlike with the table, only a small crack was left.<br />
As I put a sneaker on a stretched-out foot, she must have found something funny because she burst out laughing.  </p>
<p>Isn’t this a little exciting.<br />
Rather than exciting, it’s nerve-wracking.<br />
[2Why would excitement come up here? After telling her not to touch anything, I looked around again and then went over to the checkout counter.<br />
I guess I should pay for the table.<br />
Here, to pay.<br />
And the table got a little brok-.<br />
Ah, a fly.<br />
Don’t!-Pajik A table corner crumbled like some kind of biscuit.<br />
Yerim laughed, saying ‘oh dear’.  </p>
<p>I caught all the bugs in the restaurant.<br />
It must have become a habit, ahaha.<br />
Don’t laugh.<br />
The employee inside the checkout counter stared back and forth between the table and Yerim with huge eyes.<br />
I’m so sorry for my kid.<br />
I handed over both an apology and a card.  </p>
<p>Please include the costs of our seated table and that table.<br />
It’s okay to take off a lot.<br />
com The way back to Haeyeon Guild was relatively smooth.<br />
The car’s frontseat headrest was crushed and once we got off, the sidewalk curb was split, but nobody was hurt so it was okay.<br />
That said, don’t come near, Yerim.<br />
She kept on trying to cling.<br />
The sudden change must have made you uneasy but if you just grab me once, my arm will shatter.<br />
I’m stat F.<br />
I only told Haeyeon Guild’s Guild Leader Yoohyun about Bak Yerim.<br />
That was because if word leaked out at any moment, it would become troublesome.<br />
I planned on letting word about the new S-Rank be known at the rank evaluation at the Hunter Association.<br />
So that there wouldn’t be any unfortunate victims, while Kim Sunghan was on guard against the surroundings, we went up the elevator.<br />
There weren’t a lot of people in the lobby due to it being a weekend evening, so it was a huge relief.<br />
Excluding floors 1~3, to go into the area, you had to go through a security check, but Yoohyun had notified them ahead of time, so thanks to that, we got to skip it.  </p>
<p>My heart is beating a little.<br />
As soon as the elevator door closed, Yerim came closer to me again.  </p>
<p>Don’t stick to me.<br />
There’s no place for me to escape.<br />
I won’t disturb you.<br />
You think I can’t control it that much.<br />
You’re saying that after crushing the headrest? If a person was there you would have become a murderer.<br />
com At the talk of being a murderer, Yerim’s lip stuck straight out.<br />
I wondered if my words were too much, but thinking of the future, giving this amount of warning seemed better.<br />
An Unawakened Person and stat S-Rank were different to the extent of being different species.<br />
In order to prevent accidents, she had to bear in mind constantly the truth that she wasn’t normal.<br />
In the guild leader’s office, there weren’t other people and only Yoohyun was there waiting.<br />
As soon as we entered, this guy put on a business-like smile.  </p>
<p>Please come in, Bak Yerim-yang[3.<br />
…Hello.<br />
Yerim awkwardly bobbed her head in greeting.<br />
Strange, she didn’t seem like someone shy with strangers.  </p>
<p>First of all, I will guide you to where you will stay while you are adjusting to the ability change.<br />
Stat S-Ranks finish adjusting in one day, on average.<br />
After that, it is possible for your daily life to stay the same as before, so there is no need to worry.<br />
Yoohyun explained, courteously.<br />
It was definitely an unfamiliar image.<br />
Though if you thought about an S-Rank Awakened Person’s worth, that was standard.<br />
Did I treat Yerim too casually?.<br />
Please come this way.<br />
com for a better experience Yoohyun took the lead and left the room.<br />
What do I do.<br />
It’s getting to be time to feed Peace, so could I leave?.<br />
Ahjussi, what are you doing not coming over!While I was standing there blankly, Bak Yerim gestured to me and called me over.<br />
She even glared at me, as if asking why I wasn’t hurrying.<br />
Now that I thought of it, I did say I would be her guardian.<br />
I guess I had to follow.<br />
Unlike when we were coming up the elevator, the elevator didn’t stop at the 1~3 floors, and we went down to the basement.<br />
In the basement, there was a training facility for Awakened People.<br />
Following the long hallway, Yoohyun continued explaining.  </p>
<p>The basement 2nd to 3rd floors are spaces for training.<br />
For safety reasons, you have to go to the training center located in Gyeongi Province for the training for just A-Ranks and above in full-fledged battle.<br />
Skills with killing power especially are strictly prohibited from being used in the downtown area so please take care.<br />
…It seems like there’s a lot to learn.<br />
After registering as an Awakened Person, you will formally receive training.<br />
Until then, you only need to take care when using your skills.<br />
Okay.<br />
com Now that I thought of it, I wondered what Yerim’s skills’ effects were.<br />
I was curious.  </p>
<p>This stamina training room is where Bak Yerim-yang will remain for one day.<br />
The place we arrived at was a wide room with various athletic equipment.<br />
There was a high ceiling, and the walls and floors that didn’t seem to be made out of normal material stood out.  </p>
<p>Even if the equipment here are broken, it does not matter.<br />
Please use them to familiarize yourself with your senses.<br />
The walls and floor can handle an S-Rank level 1’s physical strength.<br />
By any chance, is your Strength stat above 100.<br />
No.<br />
It is 61.<br />
That much will be no trouble.<br />
It was 61.<br />
It was as much as 3 times the sum of my stats.<br />
Just looking at Strength, it was 15 times.<br />
Just because the stat was 15 times didn’t mean actual strength was 15 times, but it was definitely a difference that meant I couldn’t dare to approach her.  </p>
<p>Over there, a showering room and a sleeping room has been provided.<br />
Again, if the two facilities are broken, there is no need to worry, but if possible, please use them after adjusting to your strength to a certain extent.<br />
You can request for it through the phone in the sleeping room.<br />
If you happen to break the phone, please press the emergency bell next to the sleeping room door.<br />
Yoohyun asked if she had any other questions besides that.<br />
Bak Yerim shook her head to reply.  </p>
<p>Then, the remaining information will be given tomorrow after you adjust to your abilities.<br />
Saying so, Yoohyun turned around.<br />
I should also go up and give Peace food.<br />
He[4 must be waiting.  </p>
<p>Ahjussi, where are you going!As I was about to turn, Yerim yelled shrilly.<br />
What do you mean, where.  </p>
<p>I’m going home.<br />
And leave me here alone? How could you? You said you’d take responsibility!It wasn’t wrong but the nuance was a little odd.<br />
Yoohyun stopped walking out and turned his head to look at me.<br />
com for the best novel reading experience.<br />
Responsibility? Hyung.<br />
I said I would be her guardian.<br />
Guardian.<br />
Her parents aren’t here, and she doesn’t have a good relationship with the uncle she is living with.<br />
She didn’t want to be involved with that family.<br />
There wasn’t anything bad.<br />
But Yoohyun’s expression looked bad.  </p>
<p>If the guardians for Awakened minors aren’t their parents, they’re usually Awakened People whose ranks are higher or around the same.<br />
That’s the only way to have control.<br />
If she needs a guardian then it’s better if I-.<br />
Ahjussi already said he would, okay?Bak Yerim cut in through Yoohyun’s words.<br />
Her expression was icy, unbecoming of her age, and I thought of the ice witch Bak Yerim I saw in the past that was also the future.<br />
Why was she overreacting now.  </p>
<p>Bak Yerim-yang.<br />
Even just for the guardian’s safety, that cannot be done.<br />
There are already many cases of guardians with lower ranks and not even a safety net of being blood-related being assaulted by their guardees while giving advice.<br />
com Uh… there was that kind problem too.<br />
Well, dealing with a teenager a lot stronger than you and going through the tough period of adolescence wouldn’t be an easy task.<br />
Thinking like that, I got a little scared.<br />
Since the contract said that Yerim would protect me, would it be okay?.<br />
I contracted to protect ahjussi.<br />
So there’s no problem with safety.<br />
From the start I didn’t have the thought to hurt ahjussi.<br />
Even so, there is also another problem of hyung not being able to properly take on the role of guardian.<br />
Not to mention, the difference in rank is too high, and other than that, various other troubles probably will follow.<br />
…I don’t know, all of that.<br />
But.<br />
Bak Yerim looked at me once and continued talking.  </p>
<p>If you don’t give me ahjussi as my guardian, I won’t enter Haeyeon Guild.<br />
…What? No, wait? [1 last ch, they said they went into a room.<br />
In some restaurants, you can get private rooms with floors that are slightly raised platforms, where you take off your shoes outside and go in and sit on cushions at a low table.<br />
[2 in the prev.<br />
sentence YR asks lit.  </p>
<p>doesn’t this make [heart flutter?(where ‘heart’ isn’t really said, bc the particular word for.<br />
flutteris often used by itself, and either way means.<br />
excitement”), and so YJ replied.<br />
rather than shake, my skinflesh is trembling.<br />
The meaning is as written in the tl.<br />
[3 an female-only honorific that is basically the equivalent of.<br />
miss[4 I felt kind of bad using ‘it’ esp now that he has a name.<br />
Once again, krn doesn’t really use pronouns so idk if he even is a ‘he’ or a ‘she’ in the first place, and anyways who cares about gender.<br />
I’m just using ‘he’ just because.  </p>
